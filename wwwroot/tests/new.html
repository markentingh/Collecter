<p><font size="2">The exhibition of every hue of the rainbow and the apparent
variation in size and distance of the sun, can be explained by the so called <a href="#Sun Dogs">Sun
Dogs, also called mock suns or false suns</a>.</font>&nbsp; <font size="2">The</font>
 spinning of the sun and its pulsations might be explained by the <font size="2"> Troxler
phenomenon</font>.
<br>When the gaze is fixed intently on an object for a long time, peripheral images that tend to disappear reappear immediately when the eyes are moved. This effect is called the Troxler phenomenon. To study it reproducibly it is necessary to use an optical device that ensures that the image of any object upon which the gaze is fixed will remain on the same part of the retina however the eyes move. Two investigators found, when they did this, that the stabilized retinal image tended to fade within a few seconds. It may be assumed that in normal vision the normal involuntary movements--the microsaccades and drifts mentioned earlier--keep the retinal image in sufficient movement to prevent the fading, which is essentially an example of sensory adaptation, the tendency for any receptive system to cease responding to a maintained stimulus.

<p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.auf.asn.au/meteorology/section12.html">Sun pillars</a> are
<a href="http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/pillar.htm"> vertical columns of light</a> that appear above or below the sun, or both, when the sun is near the horizon. They are caused by reflection of sunlight from the near horizontal surfaces of ice crystals and are similar to the glitter path of sunlight reflected on water. Light pillars are also associated with the moon.<br>
<a href="http://www.auf.asn.au/meteorology/section12.html">The parhelic circle</a> is a reflection from the vertical surfaces of horizontally oriented flat plate or columnar crystals when very small ice crystals, diamond dust , fall through the air. The crystals reflect the light in all directions of the azimuth but always downward at the same elevation as the sun. Thus
<a href="http://www.sundog.clara.co.uk/halo/parhelia.htm"> if the sun’s elevation is 25° an observer would see the parhelic circle 360° around the horizon by looking up 25°, but usually only part of the faint white circle is
seen</a>. The parhelic circle and a sun pillar may form a cross in the sky,
centered on the sun. This was the main reason why the ancients associated the
cross symbol to the sun.</font>

<p><font size="4"><img border="0" src="images/Sungazing.jpg" align="right" width="247" height="112"></font><b>Socrates</b> (c. 469-399 B.C.) was the greatest Greek philosopher according to the Oracle of Delphi.&nbsp;<br>
In Plato's Phædrus, Socrates is made to say that "our greatest blessings come to us by way of madness." Then Socrates said: "For prophecy is a madness, and the prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona when out of their senses have conferred great benefits on Hellas, both in public and private life, but when in their senses few or none." (Phaedrus, 243)<br>
Aristophanes, who did not understand and appreciate Socrates’ philosophy, wrote a play entitled “<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristophanes/clouds.pl.txt">The Clouds</a>” in which Socrates,
after being asked "what are you doing up there?", is saying: "I
am traversing the air and contemplating the sun." When asked what why he floats in the air, he replies, "I have to suspend my brain and mingle the subtle essence of my mind with this air, which is of the like nature, in order clearly to penetrate the things of heaven. I should have discovered nothing, had I remained on the ground to consider from below the things that are above; for the earth by its force attracts the sap of the mind to itself.  It's just the same with the watercress."
Let's mention that the Brahmans also used to levitate while sungazing. According to
Philostratus , the Brahmans levitate at will in the air "not for the sake of vain glory, but to be nearer their Sun God," to whom they pray.

<br>
Socrates did also moon gazing. One cold winter night he was out amidst an olive grove. At daybreak
when his wife Xanthippe, found him missing a search party was sent out. They found Socrates frozen like a Greek statue. When asked about
this strange experience Socrates said: "I was gazing at the moon and suddenly my soul separated from the body and thus I did not know what to do, until you came and resuscitated me".<br>
In Plato's Symposium, Socrates freezes in deep meditation en route to a drinking party (the 'symposium' of the title). The host Agathon, and the other guests, are left waiting; a slave is sent and returns reporting:  "Socrates is here, but he's gone off to the neighbour's porch. He's standing there and won't come in even though I called him several times."&nbsp;<br>
Agathon gives the order, "Go back and bring him in!" but Socrates' companion, Aristodemus, objects:  "No, no, leave him alone. It's one of his habits: every now and then he just goes off like that and stands frozen, wherever he happens to be."<br>
Alcibiades gives a further example of his deep meditative trances, being impervious to his surroundings and the heat of the Mediterranean summer Sun. He mentions also that he was praying at sunrise: "So much for that! But you should hear what else he did during that same campaign, 'The exploit our strong-hearted hero dared to do.' One day, at dawn, he started thinking about some problem or other; he just stood outside, trying to figure it out. He couldn't resolve it, but he wouldn't give up. He simply stood there, glued to the same spot. By midday, many soldiers had seen him, and, quite mystified, they told everyone that Socrates had been standing there all day, thinking about something. He was still there when evening came, and after dinner some Ionians moved their bedding outside, where it was cooler and more comfortable (all this took place in the summer), but mainly in order to watch if Socrates was going to stay out there all night. And so he did; he stood in the very same spot until dawn! He only left next morning, when the Sun came out, and he made his prayers to the new day."<br>
Pythagoras, his teacher, instructed Socrates: "Offer sacrifice and worship with thy shoes off." According to Pythagoras: “Life is like a gathering at the Olympic festival, to which, having set forth from different lives and backgrounds, people flock for three motives. To compete for the glory of the crown, to buy and sell or as spectators. So in life, some enter the services of fame and others of money, but the best choice is that of these few who spend their time in the contemplation of nature, and as lovers of wisdom.”</p><p><b>Apollonius of
Tyana</b>  was born around 4 BC at Tyana, in Cappadocia, and is last heard of in Ephesus, over 100 years later.
He was presented in the memoirs of Damis of Nineveh, the so-called Scraps from the
manger. The Scraps from the manger were given to Philostratus by the empress Julia Domna. The neo-Pythagorean sage who is described by Damis, worships the Sun. This element is almost absent from earlier
Pythagorean works.<br>
Philostratus frequently mentions Apollonius' prayers to the sun, something for which we do not find antecedents in the Pythagorean literature.
“For he said that, whereas other men only make conjectures about the
divinity and make guesses that contradict one another concerning it, -- in his
own case he said that Apollo had come to him acknowledging that he was the God
in person” (<a href="http://www.apollonius.net/introduction.html">Flavius
Philostratus, The Life Of Apollonius Of Tyana</a>)
<br>When Apollonius inquired Iarchas, the leader of Brahman sages, of&nbsp; whether the cosmos was composed of four elements, the latter replied that it was made not of four but of five, the fifth being the ether. There is, said the Indian sage, "the ether, which we must regard as the stuff of which gods are made, for just as mortal creatures inhale the air, so do immortal and divine natures inhale the ether."
Damis saw too, the fire that they drew from the sun's rays, while they worshipped the solar orb.
<br>Either sunrise or at
noon, Apollonius would say the following  prayer:<br>
"O thou Sun, send me as far over the earth as is my pleasure and thine,<br>
and may I make the acquaintance of good beings,<br>
but never hear anything of bad ones, nor they of me."

</p><p><b>Omram Michael Aivanhov</b>:
"Human beings are so unaccustomed to using their God-given psychic and spiritual faculties that they have no idea what to do when they see the sun rising. They soon start yawning with boredom. They are tired of watching that brilliant sphere in the sky. So they leave the sun and go to take care of more tangible, more important things!...&nbsp;<br>
  What is so extraordinary is that many people, finding themselves by chance in front of the rising sun, acknowledge that it is one of the most beautiful sights one can see, but that does not mean they are ready to make an effort to renew the experience. Yes, how many would feel impelled to get up early to greet the dawn, to welcome that light into their hearts and souls so that the whole day may be luminous and pure?"<br>
"The ego is the ultimate black hole. It sucks in light but emits none. The Sun is the exact opposite of the ego. It ceaselessly bestows life upon the world. Its life is a true sacrifice. This secret message was
clearly understood by the ancient
rishis."
<br>"You will understand how important it is for you to receive these particles of sunlight that vibrate with such intensity, so that your etheric body may become strong and radiant and safe from attack by disorder, illness or dicouragement of any kind."
<br>
"In your thought, with your imagination, try to draw some of these divine particles [of the Sun] into yourself. In this way, little by
little, you will completely regenerate all the materials of your being. Thanks to the Sun you will think and act as a child of
God."
<br>"When we focus our attention on the sun, the centre of our universe, we
draw closer to our own centre, our higher self, the sun within; we melt into it
and begin to resemble it more and more."<br>
"The world needs more and more human beings capable of dedicating themselves to this work with the sun, for only love and light are capable of transforming
humanity."&nbsp;
<br>"You go and watch the sunrise for your morning meditation, but you will not gain a great deal from this exercise if you do not prepare
yourself; possibly the night before, but certainly from the moment you set off before dawn you must hold firmly in your head and in your heart
the belief that you will not just assist but also participate in this incredible event taking place in the universe.[...]&nbsp;You will say that the sun will always rise, whether you are there to
watch it or not. Yes, you are right, <a href="http://www.videlinata.ch/frame_3_gb.h"> the sun does not need you to rise
in the morning.&nbsp;It is important for you, however, because there is a connection
between the events that occur in nature and those of your inner life</a>."
<br>"When you are watching the sun rise, wait, watchful and attentive, for
the first ray and as soon as the first ray appears, concentrate on absorbing it,
swallowing it. So <a href="http://www.videlinata.ch/w_sol03_gb.html"> instead of simply watching the
sunrise, you are drinking it,
you are eating it, and you imagine that this living light spreads through all
the cells of your organs, purifying them, strengthening them and enlivening
them.
This exercise not only helps you concentrate, but you will feel your entire
being quiver and illuminate because you are truly absorbing light</a>"
<br>"Light is the true beverage of immortality and you can catch this light
in the morning at sunrise and use it to nourish your subtle bodies."
<br>"If you are able to watch the sun with a free, clear mind you will feel
that you are entering into contact with it, with its spirit,<br>
and that you are absorbing its rays, like so many seeds of life."
<br>"Prana is a great river flowing from the sun and, by meditation and breathing exercises, we can obtain all the
elements we need from it."
<br>"In a dream, the sun which is rising can announce, for example: the end of a grave disease (return of health), or blooming, the
arrival of a prosperous situation,
etc."
<br>"The sunset (which is announcing night herald or darkness) represents: loss of consciousness, disease and death. It connects usto the destructive forces of decline and death. That is why it
is not recommended to contemplate sunset."
<br>
"The nearer you get to the sun in spirit, soul, and thought, with your heart and
will, the nearer you will be to God, for on the physical plane, the sun is the symbol and the tangible representative of the
Deity."
<br>Aïvanhov was always careful to emphasize, however, that the sun should not be worshipped as God:
"God must always be sought above and beyond forms.""God is utterly
ineffable, beyond our powers of conception; there is no question of thinking the sun is
God."
<br>"So, when you are gazing at the sun, try to sense that you are gazing at
God's most perfect representative on earth. This sensation will contribute to
raising the vibrations of your being to a higher level. All the elements will be
exalted in you; you will be launched into the farthest regions of space, and
even the notion of time will be abolished. Like God, you will be living in
eternity."

Mumbai. He says: "Through Suryayog, your mind naturally begins to concentrate, which is the aim of all spiritual
processes. The sun's rays collide with our thoughts and create silence. The mind is too powerful to be managed by ordinary human
consciousness. The photons from the solar system help to control the mind."

<p><b>Dimbeswar Basumatary,&nbsp;</b> a 24-year-old college dropout from Balimari village west of Assam’s capital Guwahati, has sun-gazing as his passion.
He has baffled ophthalmologists by staring at the sun for hours without blinking,
while staring at a radiant sun for just 90 seconds can cause solar burn or retina
damage.<br>
He claimed that he had tried not eating anything for four days and did not experience hunger or thirst because the sun gives him food for survival in the form of solar energy.<br>
A senior ophthalmologist Biraj Jyoti Goswami of the Sankardev Netralaya, a premier eye hospital in
Guwahati, said that Basumatary had been examined a number of times and was found to have good colour vision with no significant problems detected so far.

Umasankar</a></b><a href="http://www.anandaproject.org/links/sunyoga/swamiji.html">,</a> an Indian Yogi,  was born in 1967 in
Lachipur, near Calcutta,
into a Hindu family.&nbsp;
<br> During his time at the ashram of Pondicherry, he spent every morning meditating on a rock looking out at the sun's reflection off the sea. His daily meditation upon the reflected
sunlight onto the sea water,
which is a <a href="#POLARIZED LIGHT IN NATURE">polarized light</a>, gave him great
pleasure and became aware that, through this method of meditation, he was somehow able to absorb powerful energies from the sun's rays.
He began to experiment by looking directly at the sun, initially as it was rising, then day by day he began to concentrate on it as it rose higher into the sky. He continued his meditation and after a couple of months the sun started to appear as a "clear hazy ring with soft blue sky inside". The harsh brightness disappeared and he felt it become increasingly soothing. As time went on, he started to see "seven bright colours radiating from the sun, slowly reaching closer to the ground".<br>
During his three month period of concentrating on the sun, Swamiji had developed a great interest in the way that trees and plants are able to receive energy directly from sunlight. His discoveries now made him believe that he had found a way of absorbing the sun's energy directly into his body, charging his body's cells with kinetic energy and therefore removing the need to eat food. So, as an experiment, Swamiji stopped eating breakfast and continued concentrating on the sun. Six months later, he stopped eating his dinner, then six months after that, he stopped eating food at all. From the 17th August until the 7th December 1996, Swamiji stopped eating and sleeping altogether. His body weight remained the same and he continued his daily routine working in the
ashram in a perfect state of health.

<p><font size="2"><b><img border="0" src="images/HRM.JPG" align="right" width="128" height="96"><a href="http://www.solarhealing.com/">Hira Ratan Manek</a></b>  
 (HRM) was born on 12th of September 1937 in Bodhavad, India, was raised in
Calicut, Kerala, India, where he had his Mechanical Engineering degree from the
University of Kerala. After graduation, he joined the family business, which was
shipping and spice trading, and continued working there until he retired in
1992. After he retired, he began to study on sun gazing, in which he had been
interested since his childhood. After working 3 years on this method, he was
able to find the secrets of sun gazing. During his study, he was mainly inspired
from the teachings of Lord Mahavir of Jains, who was also practicing this method
two thousand and six hundred years ago. He walked in the sun for long periods of time.
As he kept walking in the sun, he felt progressively energized. He also felt less and less need to eat food. There was no compulsion to do a fast; no will power was necessary.
He follows the jain way of fasting and he takes only water after sunrise &amp; before sunset.
He has done fasting for 211 days, from 19th June 1995 to 15th Jan 96. The fast ended in the Jain temple situated in the Gujarat.
When he completed the 211 days fast, his weight was reduced by 41 kg. and the Sugar level (Glucose) was lowered to 43.
"Medical Science says that when the glucose level of a human being decreasing below 50, then the situation becomes dangerous, even though in his case nothing has append." Said Dr. P.D.Doshi the secretary of Health Care International Multitherapy Institute.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2">HRM started a 411 days fast at 1st January 2000 and was ready to go for continuous medical checkup during his fasting.
The medical team is led by Health Care International Multitherapy Institute &amp; Jain Doctors Federation jointly. It is fully supported by Jain Yuvak Mahasangh President Dr. Jitubhai Shah.
<br>HRM has has completed 166 days of fast on 14th June 2000. His initial weight was 77
kg was reduced to 62kg. All other parameters were normal.&nbsp;On 14th Februry
2001 he completed 411 days of fasting. Except for loss of 19 Kg weight (58 kg,
which was stable with no further weight loss for last  3 months) a slight reduction of pulse rate and
B.P. and definite reduction of respiratory rate (from 18 to now 10/minute) amazingly, there is no other medical abnormality.
He has stopped passing stool after the 16th day  of fasting and urine output was maintained at around 600  to 800 c.c. His blood  sugar
was between 60 and 90.&nbsp;
</font>
</p>
<p>Even though HRM claims to have given up solid food, during the year 2005 he
was filmed eating into an Indian restaurant. He recognized, after being faced
with the evidence, that he had eaten while telling his followers that he only
consumed coffee and buttermilk.&nbsp;
<br>No person who followed his protocol/method managed so far to give up food,
or to live only on liquid food.

Nikolay saw “terrible” dreams during the first 2 weeks after he stopped eating - as if he eats appetizing buns. The man waked up in cold perspiration with the thought: “Do I really fail?” Feeling of hunger disappeared later. The indifference to food and feeling of perfect soul rest appeared then.<br>
Nikolay lost 7 kg during almost 1000 days of sun-diet. The heart problems and stomach aches disappeared and he feels as if he is 30 years old. His personal record of non-stop sungazing is of 13 hours. He makes press-ups with one arm for 30 times.<br>

<font size="2">
<p><font size="2">There are two mechanisms by which sunlight suppresses the
hunger:</font>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="2">by stimulating melanocyte
stimulating hormone (MSH) production into the pituitary gland;</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">by stimulating serotonin production and suppressing melatonin production into the pineal
    gland.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="2">Exposure to sunlight makes pituitary gland to MSH. MSH stimulates the pigmentation of the skin, but it is
also anorexigenic (suppresses hunger). Injection of MSH in one of the lateral ventricles of
rodents leads to suppression of food intake in a dose-dependent manner. </font>
<br>There was proven the physiological suppression of MSH under fasting. However, sun
gazing overrides this mechanism. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/7/4233">MSH
is leading to increased metabolism and accelerates weight loss during a fast,
by&nbsp; increasing the accessibility of fat stores.&nbsp;</a>
</p><p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12480364&amp;dopt=Abstract">The rate of production of serotonin by the brain was directly related to the prevailing duration of bright sunlight and rose rapidly with increased
luminosity</a>.
<br>To transform tryptophan into serotonine, vitamin B6 is required. Consuming more
protein than you need, requires extra vitamin B6 (and B2 and folic acid). Consuming too much proteinous food inhibits serotonine production.&nbsp;Consuming too much protein increases blood-phenylalanine level. The amino acid     phenylalanine inhibits serotonine production, through inhibiting decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophane into
serotonine. Consuming too much protein increases blood-leucine level. The amino acid leucine
enhances tryptophan-pyrrolase, irreversibly decomposing tryptophan.&nbsp;<br>
A common cause of obesity is the serotonin-deficiency. Symptoms include sugar cravings, food obsession, binge eating, depression, anxiety, and phobias.
Fasting results in increased turnover of brain serotonin (Curzon et al, 1972).
<br><font size="2">Sunlight, or simulated sunlight, stimulates the thyroid gland which boosts
metabolism and fights obesity.</font>
</font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">Melatonin is produced, in the absence of sunlight, by pineal gland. Stress, refined sugars, and other factors that increase epinephrine output
will also increase melatonin production. This is the cause of stress induced
obesity.
<br>
Melatonin does inhibit the pituitary secretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone
(MSH), which leads to increased hunger. That's why hunger is hard to control
during the night and that's why the Ramadan fasting is maintained until sunset.</font>
<br>Melatonin suppresses the production of insulin by the pancreas, and therefore
causes a rise in blood sugar. In contrast, calcium and vitamin D appears to
stimulate the production of insulin. <a href="http://www.projectrestore.com/library/radiant_living/08_modern_lifestyle_challenges.htm">Exposure to sunlight lowers blood sugar by stimulating its storage in the muscles and liver.</a> Diabetics are
benefited by getting moderate amounts of sunshine, but lengthy sunbathing is not recommended.
<br>
<a href="#SUNLIGHT AND THE PINEAL GLAND">
The pineal gland</a> produces melatonin from serotonin, causing a decrease of the
serotonin level.&nbsp;
</font></p><font size="2">
<p>Twenty-two <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/31/1728_76634"> patients with both SAD and bulimia received a four-week trial of light therapy, with each session lasting 30 minutes to one
hour</a>.&nbsp;<br>
<a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/31/1728_76634">10 of the 22 patients had a complete remission of depressive symptoms following the trial, while the number of binges decreased by an average of 46%, and the number of purging events dropped by 36%, they
report</a>.&nbsp;<br>
Norman Rosenthal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C., and author of the book Winter Blues, believes that light affects the brain in such a way as to both diminish the need for food and to dampen the need for the good feelings that come with purging.&nbsp;<br>
Rosenthal also says that light increases brain levels of serotonin, a chemical involved in mood that also regulates the sense of "satiety" -- the feeling of being full after eating.
<br><a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/nutrition_guidelines/nutrition_vitaminD.html">Vegetarian and vegan diets are exceptionally poor or completely lacking in vitamin D predisposing to an absolute need for UV-B
sunlight</a>.&nbsp;
<br><a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/nutrition_guidelines/nutrition_vitaminD.html">Obesity is associated with vitamin-D deficiency. In fact, obese persons have impaired production of UV-B-stimulated D and impaired absorption of food source and supplemental D.</a><br>
When the diet lacks calcium, whether from D or calcium deficiency, there is an increase in fatty acid synthase, an enzyme that converts calories into fat. Higher levels of calcium with adequate vitamin D inhibit fatty acid synthase while diets low in calcium increase fatty acid synthase by as much as five-fold. In one study, genetically obese rats lost 60 percent of their body fat in six weeks on a diet that had moderate calorie reduction but was high in calcium. All rats supplemented with calcium showed increased body temperature indicating a shift from calorie storage to calorie burning
(thermogenesis).

<p><a name="SUNLIGHT REDUCES FATIGUE"><font size="4">SUNLIGHT REDUCES FATIGUE</font></a>
</p>
<p><font size="2">Indoor light is missing the ultraviolet (UV) component of the sunlight. When
sunlight passes through the windows, the glass is removing the UV component.
Electric light is also missing the UV radiation, because it is absorbed by the
glass of the bulbs. However, special bulbs, made of quartz</font><font size="2">,
are providing full-spectrum light. Various laboratory tests and on-site studies have shown that UV-inclusive light helps workers reduce fatigue and accidents and dramatically increases productivity. Normal fluorescent lighting actually increases fatigue and drains the body of energy and vitamin A.</font>
</p>
</font></font><p><font size="2"><font size="2">
Carbohydrates in the diet are broken down into molecules of sugar, which either
circulate as blood sugar and are therefore readily available but also readily
lost, or else they are stored for later use as glycogen. Glycogen molecules
consist of thousands of glucose or sugar units joined together in numbers of
small clusters. Each cluster contains thirty four molecules of glucose. It
represents the main source of energy for normal physical exertion, and is the
limiting factor for endurance. When all the available glycogen in muscle is used
up, the muscle relies on what energy can be brought to it in the blood. One of
the most important effects of physical training is to increase the store of
glycogen in the muscle, and this explains why athletes normally do not train for
two or three days before a competitive event - it takes this long for the
glycogen store in the muscles to be built up again.
<br>When human subjects are exposed to UV, the glycogen level in their tissues
dives in the first hour or so, and then the enzymes which manufacture glycogen
are stimulated. The level of glycogen stored in the tissues rises steadily for
about sixteen hours. (Ohkawara, A., "Glycogen Metabolism Following
Ultraviolet Irradiation", J. Invest Derm: 59; 264-268, 1972)
<br>
In parallel with the increase in glycogen stores goes a decrease in blood sugar
- or, more precisely, a normalization of abnormal blood sugar. Although most
cells in the body do not depend on glucose, being able to use their glycogen
stores, the one tissue that is most dependent on blood glucose, and which uses
up twenty per cent of it, is the brain. When the blood sugar goes down we tend
to find ourselves running out of energy and becoming drowsy, irritable and
emotional.
<br>
Blood-sugar level of rabbits during constant exposure to red light causes it to
go up rapidly while ultraviolet light reduces it.

</font> <font size="2">This effect was further confirmed in human
studies when it was shown that the blood sugar of diabetics was also lowered by
ultraviolet.
<br>Pincussen showed that by using daily doses of UV light, he could
bring the blood sugar of diabetics down very effectively. There was an immediate
improvement after the first day of treatment, and over a period of up to a
fortnight the blood sugar slowly settled down to normal and stayed there. It
showed no signs of decreasing to below the normal level, so there is no reason
for us to think that UV has a harmful hypoglycemic effect. (Pincussen, L.,
"Effect of Ultraviolet and Visible Rays on Carbohydrate Metabolism",
Arcb Phys Ther: 18; 7SO-7S5, 1937)
<br>Exposure to sunlight rises insulin level, which lowers blood
sugar by pushing sugar into cells, where it provides them energy.
Sunlight entering the eyes prevents the pineal from inhibiting the pituitary,
and thereby provides a counterbalance to the hypoglycemic effect of sunlight
hitting the skin. (Relkin, R. (ed), The Pineal Gland, Elsevier, New York, 1983. 13Tanaka, Y.,

</font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">Patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a regular
recurrence of depression during the fall and winter, caused by a drop in
serotonin levels in the brains, often improve after basking under bright light,
a technique known as phototherapy. Little is known about why phototherapy works,
but Dr. Gavin Lambert of the Baker Heart Research Institute in Melbourne,
Australia, and his team discovered that serotonin levels rise in the brain on
days with longer periods of sunlight, regardless of the season.&nbsp;</font>
<br>The Australian researchers took blood samples from the jugular veins of 101 healthy men and compared serotonin levels based on weather conditions and seasons. They found the turnover of serotonin was lowest in the winter and the amount of serotonin produced by the brain was directly linked to prevailing sunlight
duration. (Lancet , news release, Dec. 5, 2002)&nbsp;<br>
The symptoms of SAD and the “winter blues” can include fatigue, craving carbohydrates, irritability, sleeping more and a change of personality from your summer self to your winter self.
<img border="0" src="images/SAD.JPG" align="right" width="354" height="195">Four times as many women as men suffer from SAD. There is little motivation to get up in the morning or even to live at all. Low sex drive, overeating to compensate and the inevitable weight gain add to the misery.
Most people with SAD symptoms, show changes in their sleep/wake patterns and melatonin levels.
<br>A recent study at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City found that people who got a burst of artificial light in the morning were twice as likely to overcome their seasonal depression as were those who received the light in the
evening. About 80% of sufferers show the sleep delayed pattern. Their melatonin production and sleep periods begin later at night, and creep into the normal AM waking hours. These people have trouble waking up in the morning, and often never feel fully awake, even if they have slept longer than usual. This group should do sun gazing early in the morning. The other 20% who feel best in the morning, then fade steadily by afternoon, often going to sleep hours earlier than normal, should do sun gazing late afternoon.
These people feel better when treated with bright light, of over 2500 lux. The average person responds to light therapy in 2 weeks, but some people take up to a month.
However, they get worse again when given <a href="#SUNLIGHT AND THE PINEAL GLAND"> melatonin</a> capsules.

<p> Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that conveys the positive sensations of satiety, satisfaction and relaxation. It regulates appetite and when converted to melatonin helps us to sleep.<br>
<a href="http://www.hypoglycemia.asn.au/articles/serotonin_connection.html">
A deficiency of Serotonin in the brain can cause endogenous depression, upsets the appetite mechanism and may lead to obesity
</a> or other eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa.&nbsp;
<br> Sugar consumption stimulates the body to produce insulin, a hormone which transports glucose, fatty acids and amino acids (except tryptophan) into body cells. Thus insulin speeds up the absorption of amino acids other than
tryptophan.&nbsp; Normally, tryptophan must compete with other amino acids for entry into the brain, but insulin eliminates the competition, allowing tryptophan levels to rise in the brain. This leaves tryptophan available for absorption and conversion to Serotonin (via 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HTP) in the presence of vitamin B6 and magnesium, and presto we feel happy.

<br>Estrogen might inhibit vitamin B6 status and decrease brain serotonin levels.
That's why SAD is more common in women.
<br>Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil and flax-seed oil raise serotonin levels, although how they do this is unclear.

<p>A recent controlled experiment by researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle found that a simulated dawn—a gradual brightening for ninety minutes in the early morning—was more effective than a sudden burst of light for half an hour (Psychology Today, Mar/April, 2002).<br>
Daniel F. Kripke, MD and professor of Psychiatry at the University of
California, states that, "The response to light therapy is quite rapid,
often within two weeks, which is more rapid than the response to anti-depressant
drugs or psychotherapy."&nbsp;<br>
"In 1980, Dr. Fritz Hollwich conducted a study comparing the effects of sitting under strong artificial cool-white (non-full spectrum) illumination versus the effects of sitting under strong artificial illumination that simulates sunlight (full-spectrum). Using changes in the endocrine system to evaluate these effects, he found stress like levels of ACTH and cortisol (the stress hormones) in individuals in sitting under the cool-white tubes. These changes were totally absent in the individuals sitting under the sunlight-simulating tubes."

<p>The researchers from&nbsp; the Kobe University found in mice that <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-11/cp-lhs110305.php"> light sparks a cascade of gene activity in the adrenal gland through its effects on the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN)</a>. When the researchers severed the SCN, light's effect on the gland was lost.<br>
"The surge of blood corticosterone after light exposure indicates that environmental signals are instantly converted to glucocorticoid signals in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid," said Hitoshi Okamura of the Kobe University.<br>
Glucocorticoids--including <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-11/cp-lhs110305.php"> cortisone in humans and corticosterone in mice--play many roles throughout the body, including metabolic response to starvation, antiinflammatory immune response, and the timing of circadian rhythms in peripheral

<p>According to Dr. Julian Whitaker (Health &amp; Healing, Vol.2,No.13,12/92), "light enters your eyes and has a stimulatory effect on your hypothalamus, pineal gland, and pituitary gland--the master hormone-secreting gland of the body.

<br>A San Diego Psychiatrist, Dr. Barbara Perry,
has found that women treated with two hours of bright light in the evening
experienced a reversal of their PMS symptoms. Her findings, published in the
American Journal of Psychiatry ("Morning Versus Bright Light Treatment of
Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder" 9/89), indicate that bright-light
treatment may become an effective alternative treatment to drug therapy for PMS.</font><br>

As puberty progresses and body size increases, the level of melatonin
decreases to its adult norm, and the level of LH rises. (Waidbauser F., and
Dietzel M., "Daily and Annual Rhythms in Human Melatonin Secretion: Role in
Puberty Control", Ann. New York Acad. Sci: 453; 205-214, 1985) LH also
peaks at the time of ovulation, and melatonin shows a drop at the same time,
which is probably due to suppression of melatonin production by estrogen.
<br>Dr. Daniel Kripke, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego,
enlisted 11 healthy male volunteers, aged 19 to 30, to test whether light affects the body levels of luteinizing hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland and assists in the production of other hormones, such as testosterone, in men. The men woke at 5 a.m. for five days and spent an hour in front of a light box giving off 1,000
lux, or much more brightness than typical indoor lighting. Later, they spent five days in front of a light box that only gave out 10
lux.
The lux is the measurement unit for illumination. In our homes we have 200 to 300
lux. A well-lit office may have 500 lux, whereas a sunny day produces 50,000 to 100,000
lux.<br>
<a href="http://www.youngagain2000.com/marcella75/noname51.html">Researchers found the body levels of luteinizing hormone grew by 69.5 percent in the men while they were exposed to the high levels of light.&nbsp;</a><br>
The researchers didn't look at women because the rapidly cycling hormones in their bodies would make it difficult to study the effect of light, Kripke says. However, luteinizing hormone does affect ovulation, he adds, and "we think light is potentially a very promising treatment for women who have ovulatory problems or long and irregular menstrual cycles."

<p>When researchers gave doses of ultraviolet to subjects in Boston, USA, they
found that a course of five doses, of increasing duration, each of them
sufficient to produce slight reddening of the skin, could double the male
hormone output.&nbsp;Some increase could be achieved whichever area of skin
received the irradiation, but while exposing the back produced a doubling in
hormones, exposing the skin of the genitals could cause the hormone level to
triple.

<img border="0" src="images/Testosterone.gif" align="right" width="330" height="160"></font>The principal male hormone, testosterone, is known to be produced by the
effect of sunlight on the skin, and particularly on the skin of the genitals.
Its level into the urine rise throughout the spring and summer months, being
about one third higher by the end of August than in February. (Myerson, A., and
Neustadt, R., "Influence of Ultraviolet Irradiation upon Excretion of Sex Hormones In the

<br>This ties in with the studies which have shown that levels of testosterone,
the major male hormone, rise by about twenty per cent through the summer,
reaching a peak in September. (Aschoff, J., "Annual Rhythms in Man", in Aschoff,

<p>The levels of 17-ketosterolds, the adrenal steroids, which are produced in response to stress, on the other hand, fall steadily to a trough in August. The further north of the equator, the more marked is the trend. Clearly, at these latitudes our bodies find winter something of a strain.&nbsp;

<p>Melatonin levels decreased in some of the blind patients when they were exposed to light, even though they couldn't see that light. But when the researchers blindfolded these patients and then turned on the lights, melatonin levels did not drop. Those findings suggest that although their eyes could not sense light in the normal way, they still were somehow regulating the release of
melatonin, providing evidence that
<a href="http://news-info.wustl.edu/tips/page/normal/506.html"> the eyes are involved in functions other than vision.<br>
Recent work by the Van Gelder lab, in close collaboration with researchers at Novartis Gene Research Foundation, has shown the protein melanopsin is critical to these non-visual light responses.</a>

UV radiation (200-400 nm) is generally considered to be outside the range of visible illumination for mammals. Experiments on hamsters confirm that wavelengths as low as 305 nm are transmitted through the clear ocular media to the retina. Furthermore,

In 1980, Hollwich studied the levels of ACTH, the adrenal-stimulating
hormone, in the blood under natural and artificial light. After a fortnight in
light from "cool white" fluorescent tubes, his subjects' ACTH levels
had climbed to abnormally high, stress levels. Two weeks under daylight returned
them to normal. But when the lights used were of a full-spectrum type, there was
no significant increase in ACTH levels. In both cases, the light intensity was
high - high enough, at 3500 lux, to suppress melatonin. (Hollwich, F., "The
Effect of Natural and Artificial Light via the Eye on the Hormonal and Metabolic

<p>UV light activates a skin hormone called solitrol, which is thought to be a form of Vitamin D3. It works to counterbalance melatonin, the hormone of darkness, produced by the pineal at night. Solitrol, the hormone of light, affects regulation of the whole body including the immune system, mood, circadian rhythms and seasonal responses.

<p>In the article "Eye protective techniques for bright light,'' published in Ophthalmology 90, 937-944 (1983), David H. Sliney wrote:
"When the sun is low in the sky it is yellow or orange indicating that the hazardous blue light has been scattered out of the direct path of sunlight, and the sun may be fixated for many minutes without risk."
<br>From 50% (at noon) to 93% (at dawn and dusk) of the near ultraviolet radiation (397 nm) is scattered into the sky
(Jerlov, N.G.,1976. Marine optics. New York: Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co.)
Sunlight has the highest ratio of near-infrared light at
sunrise and sunset, when the ultraviolet and blue radiation are scattered while
red and infrared are passing through the atmosphere. That's why the sun is red
at these moments, which are the best for improving the vision.

<a href="http://www.healthandage.ch/Home/gm=2!gid1=3432">Exposure to near-infrared light helps protect the retina from
damage</a>, according to a new study.
<br>Near-infrared light which is able to increase the amount of energy in cells, say researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin. They studied the new methods in rats whose retinas had been damaged by methanol, a toxic chemical.&nbsp;It is known that methanol harms the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within the cells. But exposure to an LED light could prevent this damage. The researchers believe that this method, which they call
photobiomodulation, may turn out to be a non-invasive way of treating retinal injury and preventing blindness.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, lab studies on cells showed that near-infrared wavelengths can boost the activity of mitochondria, the crucial powerhouses in cells.
<img border="0" src="images/Whelan.jpg" align="right" width="106" height="126">
In a 2002 study backed by the National Institutes of Health and the Persistence in Combat program from the Pentagon's research arm,
Harry Whelan blinded rats by giving them high doses of methanol, or wood alcohol. This is converted by the body into formic acid, a toxic chemical that inhibits the activity of mitochondria.
<a href="http://www.mercola.com/2002/jul/31/light_therapy.htm"> Within hours, the rats' energy-hungry retinal cells and optic nerves began to die, and the animals went completely blind within one to two days. But if the rats were treated with LED light with a wavelength of 670 nanometres for 105 seconds at 5, 25 and 50 hours after being dosed with methanol, they recovered 95 per cent of their sight.
</a> Remarkably, the retinas of these rats looked indistinguishable from those of normal rats. "There was some tissue regeneration, and neurons, axons and dendrites may also be reconnecting," says Whelan.
Whelan and his team have reportedly shown that <a href="http://www.e4engineering.com/item.asp?id=35069&amp;pub=de&amp;type=News"> skin and muscle cells grown in cultures and exposed to the LED infrared light grow 150 to 200 percent faster
</a> than ground control cultures not stimulated by the light.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The specially designed near-infrared LED generates infrared light that penetrates to a depth of 23 centimeters, or more that nine inches
without damaging the skin. Though three times brighter that the sun, the LED is very safe and easy to use, as well as portable.
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,60786,00.html?tw=wn_techhead_12">DNA synthesis in muscle cells quintupled after a single application of LEDs flashing at the 680-, 730- and 880-nanometer
wavelengths</a>, according to Whelan. He identified more than 20 genes that typically are associated with retinal damage, for example, and "the LED alters all of them."&nbsp;<br>
"Some increased, some decreased," she added. "But they were all brought back to normal."&nbsp;<br>
Whelan thinks that the LED pulses give the retinal cells extra energy, allowing them to heal more quickly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A natural way to expose the retina to infrared light, recommended for
persons sensitive to sunlight or that have photophobia, who usually wear sunglasses, is to watch into the
direction of the sun, preferably at noon, with the eyelids closed. The eyelids
act as filters, letting only the infrared light to reach the retina. It is
necessary a long time exposure, from 20 to 30 minutes, because the intensity
infrared light which reach the retina in this way is hundreds of times lower
than that generated by the LEDs. The big advantages are that this therapy is available to anybody
and is totally free.
</p>
<p>Sunlight influences the metabolism of fatty acids in the retina.
"Gazing directly into the sun actually improves sight and aids in overcoming
disease" (Dr. Herbert Shelton).&nbsp;<br>
After discontinuing wearing his eyeglasses, Dr. John Ott wrote that he exposed his eyes to sunlight without lenses and his vision was much improved. He recommended similar therapy to his friends and they gained similar improvement in their vision.
<br>
Writing in Psychology (July, 1929), Dr. R. A. Richardson, optician, says: "On a recent trip to Africa, I took advantage of the opportunity to find out whether cataract and blindness, often found there, were caused by the sun's intense light and heat, as I had been told. To my surprise, I discovered that the persons blinded by cataract were not those who worked in the open sunshine, but in the small shops and bazaars of Tunis. Questioning them, I traced their trouble to over-indulgence in proteins, sugars and starches, nicotine and caffeine."

</p><p>An elderly man in the audience arose, and identified himself as a veteran of the Korean war.  He had, he said, worn glasses for much of his life, and had been POW held by the Koreans for about 9 months near the end of the Koran war.  At some point, an apparently sadistic but curious medical doctor at the prison camp had selected 10 men – this man was one of the ten – and forced them to stare at the sun for 10 hours per day, including high noon.  If a prisoner resisted or looked away, or closed their eyes, guards would beat them, and the prisoner risked death.  While the former POW reported that it was decidedly unpleasant sitting and
<a href="http://www.rawpaleodiet.org/sungazing/"> staring at the sun for 10 hours a day, almost non-stop, and that he and the other prisoners all developed massive headaches and
neckaches, none apparently experienced any long-term negative effect upon their vision or their eyes.

Folks often report really nasty headaches and sinus pains which may last for days afterward, especially when first starting.
The headaches and migraines are caused by the increased levels of serotonin,
induced by sun gazing. Serotonin is a potent vasoconstrictor and the headaches
and migraines are the consequence of that.

</p><p>According to one scientific research report (ISBN: 0-8194-1500-6) blood exposed to infrared light had less blood cell aggregation (clumping together) which would free up more surface area of red blood cells to transfer nutrients and oxygen to tissues.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/Light_and_ATP_synthesis.jpg" align="right" width="400" height="300">
Britton Chance of the University of Pennsylvania has shown that about 50 per cent of the near-infrared light is absorbed by mitochondrial proteins called chromophores. Whelan and his colleagues think the light boosts the activity of a chromophore called cytochrome c oxidase, a key component of the energy-generating machinery.
Whelan's theory is that <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,60786,00.html?tw=wn_techhead_12">the
photons of the infrared light give the cytochrome electrons it ordinarily would get from sugar. Light becomes a substitute for food, basically.&nbsp;</a>

absorb photons and transform their energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the
form of energy that cells utilize</a>. The resulting ATP is then used to power
metabolic processes; synthesize DNA, RNA, proteins, enzymes, and other products

proliferation; and restore homeostasis.&nbsp;

THE BILIRUBIN AND THE LIVER</a></font>

</p><p><font size="2">Bilirubin is produced in bone marrow cells and in the liver as the end product of red-blood-cell (hemoglobin) breakdown. The amount of bilirubin manufactured relates directly to the quantity of blood cells destroyed. About 0.5 to 2 grams are produced daily.<br>
Newborns with moderately severe jaundice are placed under powerful florescent lights which are designed to emit light at a specific wavelength (range for maximum absorption of bilirubin is 400 - 500 nanometres,
corresponding to blue near-UV light) which accomplish the isomerisation of unconjugated bilirubin in the skin. This molecule is converted from the toxic, fat soluble form which can enter and damage the baby's brain tissues to a harmless, water soluble form which is excreted in the urine and stool more readily.<br>
Research of Dr. Dan Oren at Harvard has shown that SAD can be caused by excessive bilirubin. The idea behind it is basically that in the winter there is a lot less UV light to break down the bilirubin, which directly affects the brain to cause depression.

</font></p><p><font size="2">In the liver bilirubin conjugates with glucuronic acid made from the sugar glucose. It is then concentrated to about 1,000 times the strength found in blood plasma. Conjugated bilirubin passes from the gallbladder or liver into the intestine.&nbsp;
<br>In the Chinese traditional medicine, "<a href="http://www.itmonline.org/5organs/liver.htm">the eyes represent the orifices of the
liver</a>. When a person closes his/her eyes and falls asleep, the blood returns to the liver. From there it is transmitted to the eyes, and the ability to see results from this. When a person sleeps, now, the nameless fire within grows dim in order to
revitalize." - Yang Jizhou, The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion
(Zhenjiu Dacheng), ca. 1590<br>In the Suwen and Neijing it says, "<a href="http://tcmbasics.com/zangfu_5zang_liver.htm">Liver qi is in communication with the eyes, so the eyes will be able to distinguish the five
colors</a>." A person's eyesight may therefore also serve as an indicator for liver function.
If the liver blood is insufficient, there will be a dryness of the eyes, blurred vision, myopia, "floaters" in the eyes, color blindness or night blindness.
<br>For the yogis, the Surya chakra (Sun's wheel) controls the liver is assisting the Manipura

The heart's action is also affected, as is the peristaltic motion of the intestines. When sight is regained, an unmistakable activation of these organic functions is observable.<br>
Dr Liberman observed that natural sunlight is required as a catalyst to ensure complete digestion.

<a name="SUNLIGHT AND THE PINEAL GLAND"><font size="4">SUNLIGHT AND THE PINEAL GLAND</font></a>

</p><p><font size="2">The Pineal Gland produces serotonin and is the richest site of serotonin in the brain.
Serotonin is responsable for the "Psychadelic Experience".&nbsp;Considerable excess of serotonin was found in the Pineal Gland of mental patients &amp; schizophrenics.&nbsp;
</font>
<br>
Administration of pineal extract to rats increased their life-span by up to
twenty five per cent. (Ralph, C., "Pineal Bodies and
Thermoregulation", Relkin, R., (ed), The Pineal Gland, Elsevier, New York,
1983)
<br>
The Pineal Gland metabolizes serotonin into the hormone Melatonin. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland around twilight, in response to the diminishing light, and helps in the sleep process.&nbsp;
<br>The suppression of melatonin from the pineal gland requires a minimum intensity of 2500 lux, compared to the probably maximum of 1000 lux in indoor office environments.
(Wurtman, R.J., and Moskowitz, M.A., The Pineal Organ, The New England Journal of Medicine 296; 23: 1329-1333,
1977)
<br>
The light frequency most effective at suppressing melatonin and therefore at altering biorhythms is between 450 and 550 nanometers.
(Rosenthal, N.E., et al., 'Seasonal Affective Disorder and Phototherapy' Ann. New York Acad. Sci: 435;
254-260,1985) This is blue and green light. The effect spills over into the ultraviolet, but there is virtually no effect from the higher - yellow and red - frequencies. The level of light that is required for melatonin suppression is roughly that of a cloudy day.
When our eyes are exposed to such level of light, our pineal stop producing melatonin within about half an hour.
We know that it's not simply a psychological response, because it can still happen in blind people.
(Wurtman, R.J., and Moskowitz, M.A., 'The Pineal Organ', New England Journal of
Medicine: 296; 1329-1333, 1977) However, it is abolished with loss of the eyes
themselves. This is because the pathway starts with the reception of light by cells in the retina but then travels by a different set of nerves from the optic nerve, which carries visual signals. This pathway leads by a circuitous route to the pineal, where the signal is given to turn off melatonin synthesis.
<br>Certain body functions, such as the regulation of human sleep-wake cycles and other biorhythms, require exposure to intensities of 4000 lux or more.&nbsp;
<br>Stress, refined sugars, and other factors that increase epinephrine output (as well as epinephrine medications) will increase melatonin production.
The excess of melatonin cause alcoholism and whitens the skin.<br>
Research by Dr. K. Blum at the University of Texas medical school showed that in total darkness rats preferred drinking alcohol to water, while if their pineal glands were removed their preferences would be reversed. Other studies where melatonin was injected into rats turned them into alcoholics.
People from northern countries have increased melatonin, during the winter time,
due to the weak sunlight, and that’s the reason they have a particular preference for alcohol..<br>
The methoxyindoles are synthesized by the pineal in the absence of light and presumably exert inhibitory effects on the gonads.
<br>Melatonin is the first substance that has been shown to safely and effectively lower core body temperature in humans.&nbsp;
<br>Larval forms of amphibians undergo a marked blanching when maintained for a time in darkness. A similar response is displayed by many fishes.
Blanching, which means the suppressing of melanin pigment, results from the release of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) from the pineal.
Melatonin exerts a profound contracting effect on dermal melanophores (pigment pores) leading to rapid blanching.

<p><a name="MELANIN AND NEUROMELANIN"><font size="4">MELANIN AND NEUROMELANIN</font></a>
 </p>

<p>There are three types of melanin in humans:&nbsp;
 </p>

<ol>
  <li>Eumelanin: brown black pigment derived from tyrosine following its conversion to dopa
    (dihydroxyphenylalanine)</li>
  <li>Phaomelanin: reddish-brown pigment which are cystine derivatives of eumelanin&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
Neuromelanin: dopamine with 10-20% incorporation of cysteine.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Melanin_network.JPG" align="right" width="411" height="264">In plants and microorganisms is found a fourth type of melanin, called
allomelanin (similar to eumelanin) formed from catechols via
polyhydroxynapthalene. It has a self-assembled network structure, resembling
a neural network. It provides basis for the neuro-network of plants, possibly conducting signals.
<br>Melanins have unique properties:<br>
– biopolymeric semiconductor (band gap of ~1.4eV – tuneable)<br>
– biopolymeric photoconductor<br>
– electronically bistable with a conducting transition at biological field strengths (McGinness, Cory &amp; Procter,
, Science, 1974)</p>

<p>The microscopic structure of iridescent bird feathers are made up of stacks of melanin rods within layers of keratin, creating a space lattice.
This lattice acts as a photonic crystal, with the number and spacing of the rods determining the colour of that part of the feather.<br>
 The lattice constants for the blue, green, and yellow barbules are  140, 150, and 165 nm, respectively.
The number of periods is  9–12 for the blue and green barbules,  6 for the yellow
barbule (see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/22/12576/FIG1">electron
microscope images of barbule structures</a>).<br>
Since the melanin granules have a much higher refractive index than the keratin the phenomenon of iridescence is possible.<br>
Melanin absorbs much of the light not reflected by the iridescence and enhances the brilliance of the color. Additionally, at certain angles the reflected light will be highly polarized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An experiment at the University of Arizona where male patients were injected with a melanin extract, was designed to see if skin could be chemically darkened to prevent skin cancer. Results showed, as a side effect, that men became sexually aroused.<br>
Melanotan - a synthetic version of a natural cell-activating hormone called alpa-MSH
(melanocyte stimulating hormone), which the body produces after a sunburn - was found to have other effects, including suppressing appetite and stimulating sexual desire. It works directly on the brain, where it affects a human's sexual desire as well as sexual performance.
<br>
According to Robins, 1991, darker pigmentation found in the genitals, may have evolved for the “protection of reproductive capacity”, in that the pigmentation protects gametes within the genitalia from ultraviolet radiation damage.
<br>
When the chest and back are exposed to sunlight, the male sex hormones may increase by up to 120%.

</font><p><font size="2"><font size="2">
Neuromelanin is found into the eyes and in Substantia Nigra and Locus Coeruleus from brain.
People with more eye melanin have less occurrence of macular degeneration; people with less eye melanin have greater occurrence of macular degeneration. About 15% of our original supply of melanin is lost in the eye by the age of forty and about 25% is lost by the age of fifty.<br>
The brain center with the deepest pigmentation is the Locus Coeruleus or black dot. The Locus Coeruleus supplies the pineal gland with
norepinephrine. The less melanin, the more calcified the pineal gland and less access the individual has to the spiritual world.
Women with a calcified pineal gland (associated with a low production of
melatonin) have a significantly greater risk of developing breast cancer.
The pineal gland secretes melatonin, which activates the pituitary to release
M.S.H. (Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone).  It is in the melanocytes that melanin (Greek “melas”=black) is produced.  Melanin is somewhat analogous to chlorophyll in plants.&nbsp;<br>
 Neuromelanin consists mostly of dopamine with 10-20% incorporation of cysteine.<br>
X ray diffraction studies have shown that neuromelanin has a multi-layer (graphite-like) three dimensional structure similar to synthetic and naturally occurring
melanins, but, these layers are stacked much higher in neuromelanin than in any other synthetic and naturally occurring
melanins.<br>
Neuromelanin was identified as a genuine melanin with a strong chelating ability for iron and an afinity for compounds such as lipids, pesticides, and
MPP+. It plays a protective role by inactivating the iron ions that induce oxidative stress. When free neuronal iron increases to the point where neuromelanin becomes saturated and it starts to catalyse the production of free radicals, neuromelanin would become
cytotoxic. Because hydrogen peroxide can degrade neuromelanin, the pigmented neurones could loose this putatively protective agent. The consequence is a release of iron and other cytotoxic metals or compounds from neuromelanin that accelerates neuronal death, as in Parkinson’s disease. The most consistent pathological finding in Parkinson’s disease is degeneration of the melanin-containing cells in the pars compacta of the substantia
nigra. The more profound degree of hypomelanization found in the right substantia nigra explains the left (side of body) predominance of parkinson
symptomsism.
<br>Copper oxidizes catecholamines such as dopamine and therefore propagates neurotoxin formation.
The brain may fail to store excess catecholamines, a job normally reserved for
neuromelanin, and hence allow free circulation of neurotoxins (Smythies, 2000;
Hoffer, 1981; Hoffer, 1973).
This might under certain circumstances contribute to synaptic deletion. <a href="http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/nutritionschiz.htm"> Abnormalities in this neuromelanin storage pathway may be considered causative factors in schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease.
</a> This biochemical theory was the first presented in medical literature by Dr. Abram Hoffer M.D., Ph.D. and Dr. Humphry Osmond
M.R.C.P., D.P.M. This theory is called the adrenochrome hypothesis.&nbsp;<br>
The ability of neuromelanin to chelate other redox active metals such as copper, manganese, chromium, and toxic metals including cadmium, mercury, and lead strengthens the hypothesis that neuromelanin is a high capacity storage trapping system for metal ions and prevent s neuronal damage.<br>
The afinity of neuromelanin for a variety of inorganic and organic toxins is consistent with the protective function for
neuromelanin.<br>

<br>Dr. Holick, one of the world's foremost authorities on vitamin D and a full professor of medicine, dermatology, biophysics and physiology at the Boston University School of Medicine
said in an <a href="http://www.mercola.com/2004/apr/7/holick_tips.htm">interview</a>:
"adequate vitamin D nutrition and sensible sun exposure during childhood not only will maximize the bone health of their children but may decrease their risk of many chronic diseases in life later including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and common cancers."&nbsp;
<br>Holick has submitted a paper to the Journal of Gastroneurology summarizing
the case study&nbsp; of a
61-year-old woman who came to his Vitamin D clinic who was severely vitamin D
deficient and showed signs of significant bone decay consistent with
osteoporosis.
<br>"It was so severe when she came to my office she couldn't sit down, she
was in tears because all her bones ached so much," Holick explained.
"So what do you do? Tanning beds to the rescue."
<br> Holick exposed the woman three times a week to tanning
bed light, following the recommended exposure schedule for her skin type. The
woman's condition improved significantly.
<br>"The bone pain over several months gradually dissolved, and the vitamin
D level increased by 700 percent, just by simply being exposed to tanning bed
radiation," Holick explained.
<br>Osteoporosis is a greater problem than many people realize. More than 25
million Americans suffer from osteoporosis, 20 million of whom are women.

correlated with higher incidence of these diseases.
<br>In "The UV Advantage," Holick recommends exposing the hands, face, arms and legs to the sun for five to 15 minutes a day a few days a week,

that amount of sun exposure on a regular basis, Holick and others say.

1998, Holick published a paper in the medical journal The Lancet showing that <a href="http://www.tanningtruth.com/page.php?pid=11">41
percent of his medical students and 41 percent of his hospital patients at
Massachusetts General Hospital were vitamin D deficient</a>. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2002/boston_2002/1823457.stm"> In
Boston, he estimated 40 to 50% of adults over 50 were vitamin D deficient.</a> 
<br>Professor Holick's team has isolated a key enzyme, or body chemical, which is
involved in the processing of vitamin D. It was found in the colon. He said if
the body did not take in enough vitamin D then the enzyme would not be activated
and the body would not be able to turn the vitamin into a form it could use.
<br>The active form of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2002/boston_2002/1823457.stm"> vitamin D prevents colon cells from proliferating and
prompts them to change into more mature cells which are less capable of becoming
cancerous</a>.
<br>The Boston researchers have found the same process occurs in breast, skin and
prostate cells.
<br>Professor Holick said: "The most beneficial effect of exposure to
sunlight is vitamin D protection.
<br>Dr William Grant, an independent researcher from Virginia, has examined the
difference in cancer rates dependent on where people live. Using data from the
Atlas of Cancer Mortality, he found death rates for breast, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2002/boston_2002/1823457.stm">colon
and ovarian cancers in Boston and New England were almost twice as high as they
were in the southwest</a> from 1950 to 1994. Based on his US findings, he
estimates <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2002/boston_2002/1823457.stm">a
quarter of breast cancer deaths in the UK are as a result of vitamin D
deficiency</a>.<br>
Because of his book "The UV Advantage", launched in April 2004, the Dermatology Department Chairwoman Dr. Barbara Gilchrest asked

<font size="2">

 Holick </font>for his resignation because of disagreements with his findings.
After being with the department for more than a decade and a friend of Gilchrest's for more than 20 years, during which the two published, worked on and discussed research together, Holick said Gilchrest's response was not one he expected.
<a href="http://www.dailyfreepress.com/news/2004/04/21/News/Bumc-Professor.Resigns.Over.Book-666570.shtml">The Boston Globe reported that Gilchrest asked for his resignation partially because of ties he had with the tanning
industry.</a> Gilchrest was not available for comment, but Dr. Boni Elewski, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, said in a statement that UV exposure poses medical dangers and that "any group, organization or individual that disseminates information encouraging exposure to UV radiation, whether natural or artificial, is doing a disservice to the public."<br>

When sunlight hits the skin, it stimulates the topmost layer
of living cells, the keratinocytes. These are the cells which produce the
keratin, the hard outer layer of dead skin that protects us from germs and
injuries. It was always thought that they had no other function. But new
evidence has proved that when they are triggered by ultraviolet light,
keratinocytes produce a chemical called interleukin-1. IL-1 has a simple but
potent effect: it causes white cells, and T-cells in particular, to multiply in
number. This explains the observation that gamma globulins (the proteins in the
blood which contain antibodies) are increased for a month after exposure to
ultraviolet light.
<br>Several studies have shown that exposure to natural sunlight increases the number of the white blood cells in the body. The main white blood cell increased the most is the lymphocyte. It is the lymphocyte that plays
the leading role in defending the body in an invasion by bacteria and foreign organisms. Because the lymphocytes increase in number after a sunlight exposure, their products of defense, the antibodies like gamma globulins, also increase in the blood. This increase of lymphocytes and gamma globulins greatly increase a person's ability to fight infections. The lymphocyte is also capable of producing a substance called interferon. This substance has the ability to stop the reproduction of viruses.<br>
A very interesting substance found in almost all cells including lymphocytes is called Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (CAMP). If high levels of CAMP build up in the lymphocytes, they will be unable to function properly and will not be able to fight cancer cells. This substance is increased in the body under stress and also when such foods as coffee, tea, and chocolate are used in the diet, among other things. These substances block the natural elimination of CAMP that would normally take place.</p>

<p><font size="2">The animals given sunlight treatments eliminated toxic chemicals of some types 10-20 times as fast as the animals not receiving the sunlight treatments! Lead was removed from the body twice as fast as from those animals receiving sunlight exposure as from those that did not! The ultraviolet light in sunlight seemed to increase the enzymes that metabolize toxic chemicals and help to remove them.&nbsp;</font>
<br>Russians' experiments showed that animals exposed to the correct doses of
sunlight were capable of clearing a wide range of toxins out of their system
considerably quicker than animals reared away from the sun. The toxins that they
studied included quartz and coal dusts, toxic minerals such as lead, cadmium and
mercury, liver poisons such as carbon tetrachloride, and the neurotoxins which
these days are so heavily used worldwide as pesticides. They found that sunlight
speeded up the clearance of toxins from the body twice to as much as twenty
times. The best effect was obtained when sunlight exposure had started some time
before exposure to the toxin. (Gabovich, R.D., et al., "Effect of Ultraviolet
Radiation on Tolerance of the Organism to Chemical Substances", Vestn Akad Med
Nauk SSSR: 3; 26-28, 1975)
<br>

Nowadays, some Russian miners are required to have a treatment with ultraviolet
light every day when they leave the coal-face. (Dantsig, M., Effect and Use of
Ultraviolet Radiation, (Ultrafioletovoye Iziucheniya), Meditsina Publishing
House, Moscow, 1966)

Sunlight not only aids in moving the poisonous materials out of the body, but it also has a wonderful effect on the trace minerals needed by the organism. Sunlight's effects upon copper, molybdenum, manganese, nickel, and other important trace minerals have been studied. Following multiple exposures to sunlight, copper levels in the liver increased to almost half while tripling in the blood. Copper also
increases by about 100% in the bones, heart, skeletal muscles, and other tissues beneficially.  Therefore, we can deduce from this that sunlight can help us to metabolize and utilize the trace minerals that are<br>
necessary in our bodies.

<p>When a group of generally unfit students at the University of Illinois was
treated with ultraviolet light as well as physical education classes, their
pulse rate after exercise came down by more than ten points on average. The
students who did the same exercise but did not receive the UV light only had a
three point improvement. The experimental group also found that their recovery
time after exercise went down by thirty per cent, and their overall muscular
fitness improved by half as much again as did that of the control group. In the
cardiovascular fitness tests, the experimental group improved by almost 20 per
cent, compared to a minute 1.5 per cent improvement in the control group.
Cardiovascular fitness, in this case, referred to a combined measure of a number
of different parameters, such as resting pulse, rise of pulse after exertion,
blood pressure lying and standing, rise in blood pressure after exertion, and
time for pulse rate to return to normal after exertion. The students also
reported an increase in their interest and enthusiasm for class work, and those
receiving ultraviolet developed only half the number of colds that the control
group suffered. (Allen, R.M., and Cureton, T.K., "Effect of Ultraviolet
Radiation on Physical Fitness", Arch Phys Med: 26; 641-644,1945)
<br>The muscles underlying an area exposed directly to sunlight also show some
local effects. There is an increase in the amount of blood flowing through the
muscles, as the blood vessels relax, together with a measurable rise in the
temperature of the muscle. At the same time the work capacity and endurance of
the muscle goes up. After a single dose of UV, the effect lasts for at least
five days. (Levy, M., "Der Einfluss Ultravioletter Strahlen auf die inneren
Organe des Mans". Strablentherapie: 9; 618-623, 1919)<br>
After sunbathing, lactic acid, the by-product of muscle metabolism that causes soreness and stiffness after strenuous exercise, is significantly reduced. Sunbathing also increases the ability of the lungs to absorb
more vital oxygen, as well as the blood's capacity to carry and deliver it. Oxygen deficiency has been readily linked to a host of illnesses and discomforts ranging from chronic fatigue to cancer.

<p>Twenty-five years ago Dr John Ott investigated the background to a report
that children at a school in Illinois had five times the national rate of
leukemia. He found that the schoolhouse was a plain, modern building with very
large windows in every room, and all the pupils who developed leukemia had been
in two particular classrooms. In these two rooms the teachers always kept the
large curtains completely drawn across the windows to reduce glare and
distraction, and to keep the children's attention on schoolwork. Several years
later the two teachers in question left the school, and their replacements kept
the classroom curtains open all the time. The lights were also replaced with
cool white fluorescent ones, and of course needed to be used less. From then on
there was not a single case of leukemia in the school for as long as Dr Ott
followed it up. (Ott, John, Health and Light, Pocket Books, New York, 1973)&nbsp;
<br>Laboratory studies have found that <a href="http://www.bio-immuno-development.com/books/daylight/book.htm"> there are receptor sites for vitamin D on
cancer cells that appears capable of converting human leukemia cells
back into normal cells</a> - at least in the test tube.
<br>A Russian study found that vitamin D produces a thirty percent improvement in
body's conservation of proteins. (Dantsig, M., Effect and Use of Ultraviolet
Radiation (Ultrafioletovoye Izlucheniya), Meditsina Publishing House, Moscow,

<p>If you’re going to be outside in the sun, make sure you take your essential fatty acids (vitamin F). These include flax seed oil, primrose oil, borage oil, etc. The following quote is from a Standard Process Company bulletin:<br>
"The ultraviolet rays from the sun convert skin oil to vitamin D. Too much D is called hyper-vitaminosis D. Actually, it is not too much D but a deficiency of F, vitamin D’s antagonist.
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~lsnatural/asnews9807.html"> D picks up calcium from the stomach and puts it into the blood. F, the essential fatty acids, take it from the blood and puts it into the tissues.</a> Suppose you get D and no F. Your blood calcium level will increase at the expense of the tissue calcium level, because D not only picks up calcium from the stomach, in a deficiency of F. It brings calcium from the tissues back into the blood. That’s why farmers and other people who are in the sun a lot get thick skin if they don’t eat enough F, which is primarily in oils. They get sunstroke. Sunstroke involves high blood calcium levels with low tissue calcium levels."
<br>Vitamin D affects also the kidney:&nbsp; it causes a greater proportion of
calcium (and of course of magnesium too) to be recycled back into the
bloodstream rather than passed out in the urine. So not only do we absorb more
of it; we also waste less.
 </p>

<p>The ratio of helper to suppressor cells was fifty per cent higher in
osteoporotic patients. They then gave these patients vitamin D for two months,
and found that this brought down the T-helper/suppressor ratio in every case to
around the normal. In people of the same age without osteoporosis, who had a
normal T-helper/T-suppressor ratio to start with, vitamin D does not alter this.

<p>Both cholesterol, which is needed to make the sex hormones, and vitamin D are derived from the same substance in the body - a chemical called
squalene, which is found in the skin. There is a new theory that
<a href="http://www.whatreallyworks.co.uk/start/articles.asp?article_ID=451"> in the presence of sunlight, this squalene is converted to vitamin D but in its absence, it is converted to cholesterol.&nbsp;</a>
 <br>


Exposing human skin to sunlight for a couple of hours lowers the level of
cholesterol in the skin by at least a half. The effect is less in Negro skin,
suggesting that it is the ultraviolet, which melanin pigmentation filters out,
that is causing the effect. <font size="2">

(Rauschkolb, E.W., et al., "Effect of Ultraviolet Light on Skin
Cholesterol", J. Invest Derm: 49; 632-636, 1971)
<br>It is also known
that sunlight lowers the level of cholesterol in the blood stream in humans by 9
or 10 per cent.&nbsp;People with low or normal cholesterol are much less likely
to see a significant drop than those with a raised cholesterol. (Altschul, R.,
"Ultraviolet Irradiation and Cholesterol Metabolism", Arch Phys Med:
36; 394-398, 1955)
<br>Doctors in Russia have been using sunlight and ultraviolet light therapy on
patients with arteriosclerosis. They have found that as well as improving heart
function, the blood supply to the brain can be improved, even in patients with
arteriosclerosis of the brain. A study published in 1966 on 150 patients
reported that the mental functioning of cerebral arteriosclerosis sufferers was
improved greatly by regular sunlight baths. (Mikhailov, V.A., "Influence of Graduated
Sunlight Baths on Patients with Coronary Atherosclerosis", Soviet Med: 29;
76-79, 1966)&nbsp;</font>

</p><p>Dr. Bruce Armstrong of the University of Sydney in Australia said the impact can occur far from the patches of skin where sunlight hits. The more sunlight people receive, the less likely they are to get non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He looked at 1,398 people and found that
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4632939/"> those who got the most sun had a one-third lower risk than those who got the least.</a>

 (Hughes AM, Armstrong BK, Vajdic CM, Turner J, Grulich AE, Fritschi L, Milliken S, Kaldor J, Benke G, Kricker A. Sun exposure may<br>
protect against non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a case-control study. Int J Cancer 2004;112:865-71.)<br>
</p><p>A report from the University of Sydney on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), was published in December 2004. It is the first epidemiological study to examine the association between sunlight and NHL using direct measurements of sun exposure in individual subjects. The study, which reviews sun exposure over a time span of six decades, compares 704 Australian adults (between the ages of 20 and 74) who had a
confirmed diagnosis of NHL, to 694 control subjects without NHL. The control subjects were randomly selected and then matched to the NHL patients by age, sex and place of residence. A questionnaire and telephone interview were used to determine the number of hours spent outdoors on working and nonworking days and vacations.<br>
Contrary to expectations, the risk of NHL fell with increasing hours of sun exposure. The chance of getting NHL was 35 percent less in that portion of the study population that had the most sun exposure compared to the portion that had the least. The impact was even
greater when the scientists looked at sun exposure on non-working days. People who got a lot of sun exposure on weekends and holidays had less than half the incidence of NHL compared to those who stayed indoors on their days off. It was a remarkable difference.<br>
"Our results provide strong statistical evidence for an inverse association between sun exposure and NHL," Prof. Anne Kricker and her School of Public Health coauthors wrote in the International Journal of Cancer (Hughes 2004). Since sun exposure produces vitamin
D in the skin, these findings suggest that this essential vitamin may also protect against some deadly forms of cancer, including lymphoma. The authors say that it makes "UV-mediated synthesis of vitamin D a plausible mechanism whereby sun exposure might protect against NHL."

</p><p>Dr. William Hrushesky, an authority on how disease patterns fluctuate over time, looked at the results of more than 900,000 papilloma tests done in southern Holland between 1983 and 1998.&nbsp;<br>
August is consistently the sunniest month in southern Holland, and the screening tests picked up twice as much evidence of papilloma virus infection then as in the winter. The virus fell off sharply in September. “Sexual intercourse did not appear to explain most of the variance,” he said. Hrushesky theorizes that even though women are exposed to papilloma at roughly the same level year round, the extra sunlight weakens their defenses against it in the summer.<br>
He noted that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4632939/"> sun can dampen the body’s production of antibodies and the activation of protective T cells, the main branches of the natural defenses against infection. Other research has suggested a connection between sunlight and susceptibility to herpes and adenovirus, among other things.</a><br>

In 1987, the Wall Street Journal reported that chickens raised under full-spectrum lighting lived twice as long, laid more eggs, and were less aggressive than chickens raised under fluorescent lighting.

In the United States, researchers found that the average levels throughout
the year for people living in Palm Beach, in sunny Florida, were twice those of
people living in Seattle or Boston, a thousand miles to the north. Moreover, for
both these cities, the average level in February, when vitamin D was at its
lowest, was higher in men who worked outdoors than the level in August in people
who worked indoors. In other words, indoor workers spend their whole lives with
lower vitamin D levels than outdoor workers. (Lawson, D.E.M., et al., "The

The pH of saliva offers a window through which you can see the overall pH balance in your body.<br>
Most children have a saliva pH of 7.5. Over half of adults have a pH of 6.5 or lower, reflecting the calcium deficiency of aging and lifestyle defects.

Cancer cannot exist in an alkaline environment. All forms of arthritis are associated with excess acidity. Acid in the body dissolves both teeth and bones. Whatever health situation you are faced with, you can monitor your progress toward a proper acid/alkaline balance by testing your saliva pH.&nbsp;

It is estimated that <a href="http://www.vitaminexpress.com/news/vitamin_d.htm"> for each 5% of skin surface exposed, approximately 435 IU of Vitamin D can be manufactured. The process requires that the oil on the skin remain intact for awhile after exposure to the sun.</a> For instance, life guards and farmers, who don't go shower immediately after sweating in the sun, have the highest serum Vitamin D levels. Try to keep the oil on your skin for at least several hours after sun exposure.<br>
Typically, the sun exposure of a person in a bathing suit of 1 minimal erythema dose (which causes a slight pinkness to the skin) is equivalent to ingesting 20,000 IU of vitamin

<p><font size="2">John Ott had worn glasses since childhood, and had been spending much of his life indoors under photographic lights. By middle age he was going bald, felt generally run down and suffered from frequent colds and respiratory infections, and had X-ray evidence of arthritis in his hip. This became so severe that he used a walking stick and an old bicycle to get from his house to the shed where the cameras were housed. Having heard that the Florida weather was reputed to be very beneficial to health, and that many people retired there for that reason, he spent a holiday on the beach there, sunbathing and relaxing, but experienced absolutely no benefit. During this time he always protected his eyes with sunglasses, or at least used his own spectacles.&nbsp;<br>
Back in Chicago, and feeling no better, he happened to break his glasses. The spare pair were un-wearable, so
<a href="http://www.bio-immuno-development.com/books/daylight/book.htm"> he was outside in the sun for several days without spectacles. All of a sudden, he noticed that he didn't seem to need the cane any more, and that his joints were generally much looser and easier. He walked cautiously up and down the drive, and then literally ran upstairs, for the first time in years, to tell his wife.&nbsp;</a><br>
Deducing that sunlight was the factor, and that it was blocked by glasses, he went back to Florida for one week. During this time he never wore glasses, he tried to avoid driving in cars, and spent as much time as possible sitting out of doors in the shade. By the end of the week his arthritis had definitely improved, and he felt much fitter.&nbsp;<br>
Thirty years later, Dr. Ott is a fit, elderly gentleman who still lives in the town in Florida which he visited for that holiday. He continues his research, uses glasses only for small print, and even has a good head of gray hair.&nbsp;

<p> "Photosynthesis does not mean you need chlorophyll. This concept also we very wrongly understand.
Only the plant kingdom needs chlorophyll.
Human body can do it with a different medium." (Transcript of a Dec. 01 2002<br>
Lecture by Hira Ratan Manek). Unlike the plants, the blood contains hemin, a crystalline product of hemoglobin.<br>
Hans Fischer, the German biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1930 for research into the constitution of
hemin, the red blood
pigment, and chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, showed that there is<br>
a close relationship between hemin and chlorophyll. The only difference is that chlorophyll is bound by an atom of magnesium and hemin is bound by
iron.
<br> Chlorophyll in leaves appears green because it uses energy chiefly from the blue and red areas of the spectrum for photosynthesis, but the green light is reflected. Hemoglobin appears red because it absorbs green light, and this provides exactly the right amount of energy to shift a molecule from one structure or state to another.&nbsp;<br>
Experiments have shown that severely anemic rabbits make a rapid return to a normal blood count once chlorophyll is administered. Chlorophyll also
removes carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
wound-healing properties.<font size="4">&nbsp;</font>

<p><font size="2">Ultraviolet (UV) is that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum extending from the violet, or short-wavelength, end of the visible light range to the X-ray region.</font>
<br><font size="2">Up to 50% of daily UV is emmited between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.<br>
95 % of UV penetrates water, while 40 % reaches a depth of 50 cm.<br>
Most natural surfaces such as grass, soil and water reflect less than 10% of incident UV. However, fresh snow strongly reflects (80%) UV. Sand also reflects (10-25%) and can significantly increase
UV exposure at the beach.
</font>
<br>Surprisingly, <a href="http://www.atlantisrising.com/issue11/ar11ultraviolet.html">there
is a relatively higher amount of ultraviolet in the skyshine than in direct
sunshine</a>. The large amount of ultraviolet in skyshine accounts for the fact
that it is possible to get sunburned on a beach on a cloudy day when there is no
direct radiation from the sun.<o:p>
<br>A famous practitioner of
sun therapy was Auguste Rollier MD, whose clinic was at 5,000 feet above sea
level. Dr. Rollier, wrote a volume titled La Cure de Soleil [The Sunlight Cure]. He knew that the higher the UV dosis, the greater the success of the treatment. Many patients were healed from tuberculosis (and it was noticed that
<u> the sun did not effect a cure if the patients wore glasses impenetrable to the healing UV
rays</u>). He stated that his patients would get the best results if they received
the highest amount of ultraviolet light at this altitude. Ultraviolet intensity
increases 4% to 5% every 1000 feet ascended. He apparently substantiated
incredible results, which were published in his book La Cure de Soleil / Curing
with the Sun.<o:p>
&nbsp;</o:p></o:p></p>

</font><p><font size="2">The energy output of the Sun has its peak at a wavelength of 470 nanometers,
but the ozone and the atmosphere are absorbing in different amounts the visible
wavelengths, so that the peak luminance on the earth's surface results at 540
nm.&nbsp;</font>
<br>Of the radiation striking
the earth, approximately 50% has a visible wavelength of 400 and 700 nanometers.
Ultraviolet (100 to 400 nm) frequencies equals 5%, and infrared (over 700 nm)
wavelengths are 45% of all radiation reaching earth. UVC are the shortest
ultraviolet rays and virtually all of these frequencies are absorbed by our
atmosphere and the ozone layer. The remaining UV light that reaches the ground
is about 1-10% UVB and 90-99% UVA at midday.<o:p>
<br>&nbsp;About 95% of the UVB
incident on human skin is absorbed, but only 10% to 20% penetrates beyond the
epidermis. The amount of UVA dosage for redness in the skin is 600 to 1000 times
that of UVB. Although UVB is implicated in much of the connective tissue damage,
shorter UVA is probably responsible for the bulk of
UVA -induced photodamage.<o:p>
&nbsp;
<br>Ultraviolet-A (near UV) has a wavelength of 315-400 nanometres. Of the ultraviolet that does reach the Earth's surface, almost 99 percent is UVA radiation.
<br> UVA stimulates&nbsp; the immediate tanning response, which occurs during exposure and increases until exposure ends. It occurs in response to both UVA and certain visible wavelengths. No melanin production is involved.</o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Visible light, when administered following lethal doses of ultraviolet (UVB and
UVC), is capable of causing recovery of the cells exposed. This phenomenon, referred to as photorecovery (also called
photoreactivation, especially in microorganisms), has led to the discovery of various enzyme systems that are capable of restoring damaged nucleic acids in genes to their normal form.
<br>In 1986 Betsy Sutherland, a researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York, finally demonstrated that photo reactivation occurred in human skin.
She described its parameters quite clearly: it is light-dependent, being
stimulated best by light of wavelength 350 to 400 nanometers (UVA). When such light hits the skin, the process happens very
rapidly, clearing most of the dimers out of the tissue within minutes.
(Sutherland, B.M., "Photoreactivation and Other Ultraviolet/Visible Light
Effects on DNA in Human Skin", Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci: 453; 73-79, 1985)
<br>The remarkable fact is that although UVA stimulates synthesis of DNA,
and therefore cell activity and multiplication, it suppresses DNA synthesis
during the first hour after exposure. During this hour, the photo reactive
enzymes are able to repair most of the damaged DNA. (Pathak, M.A., "Activation
of the Melanocyte System by Ultraviolet-Radiation and Cell Transformation",
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci: 453; 328-339, 1985)
<br><img border="0" src="images/UV_irrad.JPG" align="right" width="321" height="218">Prof. Smith-Sonneborn irradiated one-celled organisms with bactericidal UV-C rays which damaged their DNA and shortened their life span (accelerated their aging process). She then proceeded to re-irradiate the cells, this time using UV-A. The cells repaired themselves
by photoreactivation (PR) and the aging process was halted. This alone was sensational news. Prof. Smith-Sonneborn wanted to know next what would happen if she resubjected the cells to UV-A. This second radiation treatment extended the cells’ lifespan by up to 50 % compared to the control group!
Cells treated with caffeine (inhibits DNA repair processes) had a drastically reduced life span.

When UV-irradiated embryos

<font size="2">

 of the hermaphroditic fish (Rivulus ocellatus marmoratus) </font>were illuminated by photoreactivating light (PRL) from fluorescent lamps, survival at the hatching stage was markedly increased.
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2911263&amp;dopt=Abstract"> The maximum recovery to UV damage was shown by embryos that were exposed to PRL for at least 6 h after UV irradiation.</a> The effect of PRL decreased 30 min after UV irradiation and no PR rescue was detected beyond 96 h.
Treatment with 2 mM caffeine for 48 h after UV irradiation increased the sensitivity of the embryos in the dark. The above results demonstrate that Rivulus embryos have an efficient PR system and a caffeine-sensitive dark repair capacity.

<br>
Research on various organisms and cell types consistently demonstrated that light alters cell metabolism, causing synthetic cell processes to dominate catabolic ones. In a recent paper, Karu described it this way: 'The primary changes induced by light are followed by a cascade of biochemical reactions in the cell that do not need further light activation.'<br>
<br>During the summer, the intensity of wavelengths below 350 nanometers is four
times higher than in winter, and below
300 nanometers there may be no radiation in winter at all. (Thorington, L.,
"Spectral Irradiance and Temporal Aspects of Natural and Artificial
Light", Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci: 453; 28-54,1985)
</p>

<p>
Ultraviolet-B (mid UV) has a wavelength of 280-315 nanometres. It is responsible for the UV radiation's best-known effects on
organisms, including tanning.
Tanning is a natural body defense relying on melanin, a chemical pigment in the skin that absorbs ultraviolet radiation and limits its penetration into tissues.
UVB accelerates the aging of skin by damaging the collagen fibres under it and is the cause of an occupational disease known as "welder's flash," or "arc eye," which is characterized by photophobia, tears in the eyes, spasm of the eyelids, and eye inflammation.
<br>

UV light of around 295 nanometers wavelength (UVB) has the potential to cause
damage to DNA and other molecules. Damaged DNA may lead to a cellular mutation -
an abnormal cell which can be the start of cancer, or in the next generation of
a genetic change or a congenital abnormality.
 </p>

<p>
Ultraviolet-C (far UV) has a wavelength of 200-280 nanometres. Far-ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by nearly all gases and materials and does not reach the Earth's surface. It is less toxic than mid UV because it does not penetrate tissues as deeply.
 </p>

<p>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">UV radiation (200-400 nm) is generally considered to be outside the range of visible illumination for mammals.
Experiments on hamsters confirm that wavelengths as low as 305 nm are transmitted through the clear ocular media to the retina. Furthermore,
<a href="http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/119/5/2201"> low irradiances of broadband (340-405 nm) and monochromatic (360 nm) UV radiation are capable of suppressing high nocturnal levels of pineal melatonin in intact, but not blind,
hamsters</a>. These data indicate that the hamster eye and neuroendocrine system are able to detect and respond to near-UV wavelengths.&nbsp;
</span>
 </p>

<p>
Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) is a key regulatory enzyme in melatonin
biosynthesis in the pineal gland. <u> Exposure of rats and chicks to UV-A during the 4th or 5th hour of the dark phase of the 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycle suppressed the night-driven NAT activity in a time-dependent manner, the effects being generally more pronounced in rats than in
chicks</u>. The UV-A-evoked suppression of the nocturnal NAT activity was completely restored within 2 h (chicks) or 3 h (rats) in animals which, after irradiation, were returned to darkness.
 </p>

<p>Solar retinitis (or photoretinitis) is the result of a photochemical injury
mechanism following exposure of the retina to shorter wavelengths in the visible
spectrum, i.e., violet and blue light, and not due to thermal burn as was
previously speculated. UV is not responsible for solar retinitis. The acute
effect of excessive UVexposure to the eye, called photokeratitis, is familiar to
the public as "welder's flash" or "snow blindness".
Photokeratitis is an acute superficial "burn" of the corneal surface
(not of the retina!), resulting from short-term exposure to high-intensity UV
radiation. The ocular media in front of the retina are transparent in the
visible and near infrared range (400 to 1400 nm) but they absorb most UV
radiation. A small UV transmission peak occurs around 320 nm in the normal eye,
with higher levels of UV-A transmission among young children.<br>
Under certain conditions (lack of antioxidants etc), UV exposure of the eyes can
trigger the cataract.<br>
When the sun is overhead at noon, the level of UV exposure is 10 times greater
than that at either 3 h before or 3 h after noon.
 </p>

<p>Researchers at John Hopkins University School of Medicine have discovered that
<a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/90/100758.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_ln_06">sulforaphane, the naturally occurring antioxidant in broccoli and broccoli sprouts, protects the eye from damage caused by the sun's ultraviolet
light</a>. This antioxidant found in broccoli is a powerful force in preventing blindness.<br>
In their latest laboratory experiment, the researchers exposed human retina cells, which protect against oxidative stress and free radicals, to various doses of
sulforaphane. Then they exposed cells to ultraviolet light -- similar to sunlight -- to produce oxidative damage.<br>
Sulforaphane protected eye cells from damage, reports Xiangqun Gao, a molecular scientist with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.<br>
Previous studies from this group of researchers have shown that <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/90/100758.htm?z=1728_00000_1000_ln_06"> sulforaphane prevents tumor growth and kills stomach bacteria that lead to ulcers and stomach cancer. In one study, they showed that feeding broccoli sprouts to rats prevented high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.&nbsp;</a>

<p>
UV light activates the synthesis of Vitamin D, which is a prerequisite for absorption of calcium and other minerals.
One of vitamin D metabolites, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, may influence the resting energy state of the muscle and also protein turnover.
<br>UV light can lower blood pressure; can increase efficiency of the heart, can improve EKG readings and blood profiles; can reduce cholesterol; can increase the level of sex hormones
(Vita-Lite has a balanced UV, and is used extensively for enhancing the mating and reproduction of indoor pet and
animals).
 </p>

<p>
Irradiation by ultraviolet B (UV-B; 280-320 nm) initiates immunosuppression of contact
hypersensitivity in mice, by exposure of the dorsal skin or the eyes to a 10 kJ/m2 dose of UV-B radiation.
<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/2mkal7g47wjey06r/">The degree of immunosuppression induced by UV-B eye irradiation was equal to that induced by UV-B skin irradiation. When mice were irradiated with UV-B into the eyes after the optic nerve had been cut, systemic immunosuppression was not induced.</a><br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.drmhijazy.com/english/chapters/chapter38.htm">Narrow-band UVB refers to a specific wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, 311 to 312 nm. This range has proved to be the most beneficial component of natural sunlight for vitilligo and Psoriasis and is promising in the treatment of some other skin conditions including atopic eczema and
vitiligo.&nbsp;</a><br>
Compared with broadband UVB, in the treatment of psoriasis, Narrow band UVB treatment has the following features:<br>
* Exposure times are shorter but of higher intensity.&nbsp;<br>
* The course of treatment is shorter<br>
* It is more likely to clear the psoriasis<br>
* Longer periods of remission occur before the psoriasis reappears<br>

<p>In his 318-page book entitled Into The Light, William C. Douglass, M.D., outlines the tremendous powers of light. He cites two cases, husband and wife, who both had the flu. One treatment completely reversed the system in both patients within two hours.<br>
In the case of serious infections, marked reduction in toxic symptoms is observed in 12 to 48 hours.<br>
Dr. William C. Douglass pointed in his newsletter, The Cutting Edge,
Nov. 1987, p. 3:<br>
"It's amazing what you can find by nosing around in the dusty archives of a
good medical library.&nbsp; I came across another remarkable therapy that the
AMA and drug industry (or whoever is in charge of suppressing non-toxic
treatments that work) have shoved down the memory hole."<br>
"<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">Back in 1933, Doctors Hancock and Knott treated a patient dying of
septicemia (blood poisoning) with ultraviolet irradiation of the blood.The patient was
moribund with a blood stream infection and obviously near death. The patient
made a complete and uneventful recovery </a>."
(Northwest Medicine, 33:200, 1934)<br>
"Searching further, I found that <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm"> in 1928 a similar terminal infection was
treated by ultraviolet light to the blood.&nbsp; This patient also made a
complete recovery</a><font size="3">. " </font>
 (Knott, AM. J. Surg., Aug. 1948, pp. 165-171)
 <br>"Finally, in 1940, 110 cases treated with ultraviolet spectral energy were reported.  The results were uniformly good.  Between 1940 and 1948 many other conditions were successfully treated, including vein inflammation (phlebitis), polio and asthma.
<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">  Up to the late 40's over 40 thousand treatments were given with ultraviolet blood
irradiation.</a>"<br>
     "And now for the most interesting part.  In 1947, Dr. G .P. Miley reported on 79 cases of virus
infection. (Rev. Gastroenterol. 15 271-277, 1948) Miley stated that ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy could be relied upon consistently to control an infection of a virus in a safe and efficient
manner." (Am. J. Surgery, Aug. 1948, pp. 170) There is a reason to believe that by destroying the
viruses in the treated sample of blood, an "autogenous vaccine" is produced that aids in rapid destruction of bloodstream
viruses.
<br>Miley, writing in Archives of Physical Therapy, Volume 25, June 1944, reports a case of
<a href="http://www.lightparty.com/Health/HealingLight.html"> a patient near death from classic botulism neurotoxin. He was unable to swallow, or see. The patient was treated with photoluminescence and within 48 hours was able both to swallow and see, and was completely clear mentally.</a><br>
As Miley said, "There is, to my knowledge, no record in medical science or of any other therapy that can produce such an effect on a patient in the last stages of botulism."&nbsp;<font size="2">&nbsp;
</font>
<br>Nearly all toxins, such as those excreted from staphylococcus, diphtheria, and tetanus organisms, are also inactivated by UV - as are, remarkably enough, all snake venoms.
<br>The Russians have successfully treated 128 comatose patients who have been poisoned by organophosphate or had psychotropic drug intoxication.

Ultraviolet irradiation typically causes the body to eliminate uric acid more rapidly, suggesting usefulness as a treatment for gout, gouty arthritis, bursitis and other inflammatory conditions of muscles and
joints.
</font>
<br>
Patients with advanced pneumonia, acute gangrenous appendicitis, multiple pelvic abscesses, and peritonitis have made hard to believe reversal of the problems in 24 to 72 hours.<br>
&nbsp;Other effects of UV irradiation of the blood include increased effficiency of oxygen exchange, dilation of coronary arteries, rapid reversal of paralytic ileus (paralyzed gut following surgery), prevention and reversal of thrombophlebitis, restoration of normal autonomic nervous system balance, and dramatic relief in 80 percent of asthma patients.

This therapy appeared to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by 50 per
cent.</font><br>
Researchers also have found that blood sugar is temporarily diminished in diabetic patients by UV irradiation. This is probably due to an increase in insulin
sensitivity.<br>
<a href="http://www.drweil.com/app/cda/drw_cda.html-command=TodayQA-questionId=98869">UV blood irradiation, also called photopheresis or extracorporeal
photochemotherapy, is an FDA-approved treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (a type of cancer affecting the skin) and its variants as well as for psoriasis. It is also used in clinical trials for treatment of such autoimmune disorders as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
scleroderma, and graft-versus-host disease, a complication that can occur after stem cell transplants.</a>
<br><font size="2">The blood, along with an anticoagulant, is collected into the Photopheresis device. The lymphocytes are separated by centrifugation to create a concentrated layer of white blood cells.
The lymphocyte layer is exposed to UVA and then returned to the patient. Red cells and plasma are returned to the patient between each cycle.</font>

</p><p>Doctors treating a range of infections from viral pneumonia, through mumps to
acute poliomyelitis, found that the illness cleared within days, and the
abnormal temperature, blood cell counts and physical signs were corrected. (Schwartz,
S.O., et al.,
"Ultraviolet Irradiation of Blood in Man", Journal of the American Medical Association, 149 No 13; 1180-1184,
1952)
<br>Some alternative practitioners offer a type of ultra violet blood irradiation (without
8-MOP or Methoxsalen, that sensitizes cells to light) for such purposes as eliminating toxins and viruses, inhibiting growth of bacteria, enhancing immunity, and increasing oxygenation of the blood.&nbsp;

</p><p><font size="2">UV light can protect against the development of coronary artery
disease and the other forms of hardening of the arteries in the first place. (Altschul,
R., "Inhibition of Experimental Cholesterol Arteriosclerosis by Ultraviolet
Irradiation", New England Journal of Medicine: 249; 96-100, 1953)
<br>A. Levin and his associates studied the <a href="http://www.lightparty.com/Health/HealingLight.html"> effect of UV blood irradiation on blockage of the arteries of the
legs</a>, a common problem in diabetics and heavy smokers. They reported positive results in eight of 11 cases with significant relief of pain, less dependence on pain killers, better sleep, better appetites and quick healing of ulcerations caused by poor circulation.<br>
Dutkevich and associates reported that 10.3 percent of surgical cases in their series developed some degree of thrombophlebitis or thrombosis following surgery if not treated with UV light therapy. Not a single case developed these venous complications if they had been treated with UV light therapy prior to or after surgery.</font>

</p><p><font size="2">Darkening of the iris colour is a well known side effect of both naturally occurring prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogues, such as isopropyl unoprostone1 and
latanoprost. Latanoprost seems to increase the number of melanocytes synthesising melanin and the melanin content of these cells. (Lindquist NG, Larsson BS, Stjernschantz J. Increased pigmentation of irideal melanocytes in primates induced by a prostaglandin analogue. Exp Eye Res 1999;69:431–6)<br>
Some investigators have speculated that prostaglandins may actually restore the natural colour of the iris, because the darkening occurs, in their opinion, more often in the peripheral, lighter part of the mixed colour irides, thus producing a more uniform iris colour. (Camras CB. The United States latanoprost study group. Comparison of latanoprost and timolol in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. A six-month, masked, multicenter trial in the United States. Ophthalmology 1996;103:138–47.)<br>
The eye color change is apparently irreversible and could represent the latanoprost related activation of melanogenesis in some superficial melanocytes, which increase their melanin content and thus become darker, resembling pigmented dots.<br>
<br>
Iridology, the science of diagnosing illness by examining the eye, dates to the nineteenth century, when an eleven-year-old boy found an owl with a broken leg.  The Hungarian prodigy noted that a black mark appeared in the owl’s eye that changed and disappeared as the leg healed.<br>
Iridology is based on the theory that the nervous system culminates in the surface of the eyes, so by studying the shape, colour and brightness of the iris, alongside the predetermined eye-colour type, an iridologist can make a diagnosis on the state of a person’s health.<br>
The black marks from the iris are absorbing more radiation from the sunlight, they are a kind of entry points for the sunlight’s energy. According to their location on the iris, these points are activating the corresponding organs.<br>
In the 1950s, an American naturopath, Dr. Bernard Jensen, mapped out the iris into six zones or rings. The six rings all relate to a system within the body.  The innermost ring is said to correspond to the stomach; the second to the small and large intestine; the third to the blood; the fourth is connected to the organs and the hormone-producing endocrine system and the fifth is the muscular-skeletal system.  The sixth and outermost ring is connected to the skin and the organs of elimination.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">Biophotons were discovered in 1923 by Russian medical scientist Professor Alexander
G. Gurwitsch, who named them "mitogenetic rays". He found that he could stimulate the growth of
cells, and their division, by exposing them to radiations from an already
growing organism. In his first experiments, be used onion roots. These were
arranged in glass tubes enveloping most of their length, so that only the parts
needed in the experiment were exposed. On the side of the detector root nearest
to the transmitter root, more cells divided, and there was an increase in size
and chemical activity.
<br>His first assumption, or hypothesis, was that this was due to
a chemical substance released from the transmitter root. So he inserted a quartz
sheet between the two roots to block any such mediators, and found that the
effect was not abolished. When a sheet of glass was interposed instead, however,
there was no response by the detector root. Since the effect could pass through
quartz, it had to be an electromagnetic wave; but if it could not pass through
glass, then it was almost certainly in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. (Gurwitsch,
A., "Die Natur des Specifischen Erregurs der Zeliteilung", Roux, Archiv: 100;
11, 1923) </font></font></p><font size="2">

<p><img border="0" src="images/Kaznacheyev_effect.jpg" align="right" width="518" height="196">Dr. Vlail Kaznacheyev was Director of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Novosibirsk. For 20 years he has been directing highly unusual experiments with twin cell cultures. In the experiments, two sealed containers were placed side by side, with a thin optical window separating them.&nbsp;<br>
A tissue was separated into two identical samples, and one sample placed in each of the two halves of the apparatus. The cells in one sample (on one side of the glass) were then subjected to a deleterious agent - a selected virus, bacterial infection, chemical poison, nuclear radiation, deadly ultraviolet radiation, etc - that led to disease and death of the exposed/infected cell culture sample. If the thin optical window was made of ordinary window glass, the uninfected cells on the other side of the window were undamaged and remained healthy. However, if the thin optical window was made of quartz, some time (usually about 12 hours) after the disease appeared in the infected sample, the same features of disease appeared in the uninfected sample. This startling
<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm"> "infection by optical coupling" occurred in a substantial percentage of the tests (70 to 80
percent)</a>. Further, if the originally uninfected cells were in optical contact with the infected cells for 18-20 hours or so, and then were correspondingly exposed (optically coupled) to another uninfected cell sample, symptoms of the infection appeared in this third sample
in an appreciable amount (20 to 30 percent). Use of the detector as a new
inductor in a successive state reduces the effect by 20-30%.&nbsp; Three or four
such stages is sufficient to eliminate the effect.

<br>The cellular disease induction effect was called the mirror cytopathogenic effect (CPE for short) by the Kaznacheyev group.  Mirror CPE appeared only when the quartz or mica window was no thicker than 0.8 mm.  A. F. Kirkin also duplicated the experiments using a thin plexiglas window.<br>
     There are conditions which enhance the effect, and others which inhibit or degrade it.
Both cultures must be maintained in complete darkness throughout the experiment.&nbsp;
Increasing the temperature to 38.5 degrees centigrade also enhances the effect (from 37% to 90% for
example). A necessary condition for the success of the experiment is the
rotation of the holder with its two optically-coupled samples at a rate of about
24-25 revolutions per hour.&nbsp; Optical contact between the inductor and
detector cells for a minimum of 4-6 hours is necessary, after which the cell
cultures can be separated.&nbsp; A longer contact time is necessary for complete
development of the irreversible effect.&nbsp;
<br>In more than 15,000 experiments, monthly variations and daily variations were
noted.&nbsp; Kaznacheyev further discovered that the Sun's activity and the
Earth's magnetic field greatly affected the results of his experiments.&nbsp; Large flashes on the sun seem to inhibit the effect. <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">In
a season of active sunspots, the mirror CPE effect becomes highly unstable</a>.
Under active sun conditions, the effect varies from 90-100% on some days to
complete absence on others. <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">Negative results appear more often in winter.</a>
<br><a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">   Irradiation of the detector-culture with a low dose of UV prior to its optical contact enhances the effect, increasing it to certainty (99-100%
)</a>. (<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">lieutenant colonel

<br>The next key finding was that bioradiation could be triggered off by exposing cells to a source of ultraviolet light. When a
graphite-arc lamp, which was the only source of UV available in laboratories at that time, was directed at a preparation of cells, they not only produced their own bioradiation in response, but an increase in metabolic activity followed as well. The implication is clear: UV from natural, sunlight sources must be equally able to stimulate our metabolisms.&nbsp;
<br>
After UVB-irradiation of cells an increase of biophotonic emission was observed in postmitotic fibroblasts.
The ultraweak photon emission of a culture medium was significantly higher at 37°C than at 25°C and after UVB-irradiation this difference was even more pronounced. While with cells in the medium no temperature dependence could be determined in unirradiated samples, after UVB-irradiation of cells an increase of biophotonic emission was observed in postmitotic fibroblasts.

</p><p>Lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POD) reactions, which are involved in the production of reactive oxygen and radical species, are shown to be associated with ultraweak photon emission in plant defense mechanisms. These enzyme reactions induced high-level ultraweak photon emission in an in vitro reaction system. The application of LOX to sweet potato slices caused photon emission directly in plants. LOX substrate promoted photon emission in chitosan-treated sweet potato, and LOX inhibitor markedly suppressed this emission. Therefore, a LOX-related pathway, including LOX and other downstream reactions, is principally associated with photon emission in plant defense mechanisms.

The secondary radiation (the energy put out by an organism or solution in
response to an input of ultraviolet energy) became stronger the more dilute the
solution. Thus a 0.02 per cent solution of nucleic acid produced its peak effect
in one fifth of the time taken by a 1 per cent solution. Similar results were
found with suspensions of bacteria. (Miley, G., 'The Knott Technique of UV blood
irradiation', New York Journal of Medicine: 42; 38-46, 1942)

</p><p>When six quartz test tubes containing bacteria were set side by side, and the first one was irradiated with UV, there was a secondary radiation emitted from the other end of the row, which was twenty seven times greater than the input
UV. (Ronge, H.E., 'Ultraviolet Irradiation with Artificial Illumination: A
Technical, Physiological and Hygienic Study', Acta Pbysiol Scand: 15 (supp. 49);
163-171, 1948)</p>

<p><font size="2">
The degree of radiation appeared to depend on what was going on in the
organism or tissue. Cells which were in the process of growing and dividing
radiated most, and cells in a state of exhaustion radiated least. In fact, the
radiation detected from human blood was highest when the individual's energy
level was high, and at its lowest after a day's hard work.&nbsp;
<br>Protti in Milan, and other researchers throughout Europe, found in the thirties that the radiation detectable from blood increased after food, and decreased with
fatigue. After a day's work or several hours physical exertion it was down to almost nothing. in a couple of hours it had returned nearly to normal. Inhaling oxygen had a boosting effect on
bioradiation, but only for about one hour. The effect of ultraviolet exposure, on the other hand, lasted for hours or even days.
(Wassitieff, L.L., "De I' influence de Travail Cerebral sur la Radiation
Mitogenetique de sang", Arch. Sciences Biol: 35; 104,1934)
<br> Blood from anybody
with a serious illness did not radiate well, and the most dramatic difference
was found with cancer patients. The lack of any radiation from the blood of people with cancer was so
striking that the researchers came to regard this as a reliable test for cancer,
and many cases of previously undiagnosed cancer are reported to have been
detected by this method. When they took samples from the malignant growth
itself, on the other hand, they found that it radiated very strongly.</font></p><font size="2">

<p>Red blood cells are peculiarly sensitive to light and will respond to it by emitting biophotons that in turn stimulate other red blood cells to do likewise.
Bacteria and viruses are more vulnerable to biophotonic emissions than are somatic cells.&nbsp;
<br>Two glasses with fresh pig blood were put next to each other. In one glass a causative agent was trickled; the blood reacted by building antibodies. Then,
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bioelectromagnetics/message/1391"> the blood in the other glass also builded antibodies, without the presence of the causative agent! When a light-absorbing wall separated the two glasses, the effect did not occur.</a><br>
<a href="http://www.natural-care.com/irradiation.htm">The UVB irradiation of a small fraction (some 5 percent) of the blood,
that spreads throughout the entire volume of the blood upon returning to the body,
induced secondary emissions (biophotons are emitted by the activated cells)
which destroyed viruses, bacteria, and--in autoimmune diseases--activated white blood cells. In autoimmune disorders it appears that the metabolically active T-cells and other immune cells absorb much greater numbers of biophotons than ordinary body cells, and this destroys them, thus slowing down or stopping the disease.</a></p>

<p>In 1974 German biophysicist Fritz-Albert Popp, without knowing the details of the
research of Gurwitsch, was able to successfully detect the existence of
biophotons, and theorizes that their origin is from cell microstructures and DNA.<br>
Popp postulates that biological systems generally have the capacity to store
coherent photons that come from the external world. According to him, the energy we extract from our food stems from the sunlight that plants store.
His analysis strongly implies that "ultraweak" photon intensity can
regulate the whole cell metabolism and related phenomena.&nbsp;<br>
Ultraweak bioluminescence, the light emitted from organisms, was found to be coherent, laser like, and typically radiating with intensities of a few tens up
to few hundreds of photons per square cm.
<br>In his "Photon Storage in Biological Systems," Popp points out the master cellular communication and control system as follows:<br>
     "The photons which we have measured can be seen as a sort of "waste" from a virtual electromagnetic field with a high coherence.  This field has a tendency to become stationary over the whole organism."<br>
     After additional analysis, he adds:<br>
     " Consequently, biological systems must exhibit 'holographic' properties to an extremely high degree.  The successful trials in&nbsp;<br>
finding 'pictures' of various organs in each other organ, such as the ear, the hands, the eyes (acupuncture, iris diagnosis) support these conclusions."
<br>Popp concludes: "From this we can easily deduce that pattern recognition, as, for example, repair mechanisms and immunity, depends finally on the coherence of the photon field within the body."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biophotons emitted from the center of fingernails and fingerprints from living humans
were measured for twenty healthy subjects. Significantly more biophotons were emitted from fingernail than fingerprint for each finger of every subject. For thumb the average biophoton emission rate
was 23.0 +/- 4.5 counts per second, and 17.2 +/- 2.0 counts per second from the nail, and print, respectively. There is a slight tendency that the little finger emits less than the other fingers. But some fingers emit far stronger than others, and it depends upon each individual subject which finger emits strongest.

<p>Thermal stimulation with moxa leads the human body to radiate biophotons. As the biophoton emission intensifies after moxa, an attempt is made to detect changes in the human body. After moxa, the photon numbers and the body temperature are observed as a time chart before and after healing in Okada's manner. In contrast with the decreasing photon number, the temperature increases during the healing.

<p> A Japanese Ki-expert held his fingers toward cultured human liver carcinoma cells, HepG2,
in culture dishes, for 5 or 10 min. After culturing for 24 h, we measured cell numbers, protein concentration per cell, certain mRNA expressions and the synthesis of regucalcin. The results were compared with those for control cells (non-treated cells). We found that
<a href="http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/2/3/387"> the number of cells in the
Ki-exposed groups were less than those in the controls by 30.3 and 40.6% with 5 and 10 min
Ki-exposure, respectively</a>. The protein content per cell in the Ki-exposed groups (5 and 10 min) was higher than that in the control groups by 38.8 and 62.9%, respectively. These results were statistically significant. Using RTPCR, we found that the mRNA expression for c-myc, a tumor stimulator gene, was decreased, while that for regucalcin, which suppresses DNA synthesis, was increased. Our molecular biological studies and mathematical model analysis demonstrated that Ki-energy inhibited cancer cell division. The data also indicate that

<p> Mitochondria are found in human cells and generate most of our energy. They
contain their own DNA, which contains key blueprints for maintaining these
cellular power plants. Defects in the power-plant blueprints result in the
cellular equivalent of a brownout, thus creating systemic energy deficiency that
leads to localized functional failures. These blueprints are inherited
exclusively from the mother.
<br> 
 Mitochondria appear to be excellent candidates for <a href="http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/g-buehler/mito.htm"> near infrared emitters of

Neutrinos are produced in many circumstances in the earth, in the sun, stars and
galaxies. The Sun may be regarded as a huge nuclear fusion reactor and hence a source of neutrinos. In order to detect these a detector has been built at the bottom of the Homestake mine in South Dakota. The reason for burying the detector so deep is that nuclear transmutation can also occur when cosmic rays interact with matter, but these are absorbed by the intervening rock leaving neutrinos as the only candidate for the transmutation. The detector is full of industrial cleaning fluid since
<a href="http://www-solar.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alan/sun_course/Introduction/Neutrino_problem.html"> Chlorine 37 is converted to Argon by the occasional
neutrino</a>; measuring the Argon content gives a measure of the neutrino flux through the detector.&nbsp;<br>
The measured neutrino flux is only a third of that predicted by nuclear physics. A suggestion is that if neutrinos possess mass they may alternate between their three types (electron, tauon and muon neutrinos) with only one form being detected.
</font><font size="2">
That "solar neutrino problem" has persisted for many years, since 1968 when the first solar neutrino experiment, for which Ray Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize, made observations of electron neutrinos from the sun.

For eight years, from 1875 to 1883, a German biologist named von Herzeele grew plants without soil, using solutions whose mineral content he measured and controlled. Like scientists before him in England, France and Germany he found that there were elements in the ashes of the plants he grew that could not have got in from the growth medium. He concluded that
"plants are capable of effecting the transmutation of elements."&nbsp;<br>
In the 1940s M. Baranger at the Ecole Polytechnic, Paris, decided to repeat von Herzeele's experiments but with tighter controls and greater precautions against error. He also performed a much larger number of experiments. His study lasted four years and involved thousands of analyses. Baranger measured the phosphor, potassium and calcium content of vetch seeds before and after germination in twice-distilled water. In some cases pure calcium chloride was added.
He found that, <a href="http://seasilver.threadnet.com/Preventorium/transmute.htm"> in the case of seeds germinated using added calcium chloride, they experienced a 10 per cent increase in their potassium content and a significant decrease in their phosphor content.
</a> He concluded,
"These results, obtained by taking all possible precautions, confirm the general conclusions proposed by V. Herzeele and lead one to think that under certain conditions the plants are capable of forming elements which did not exist before in the external
environment."&nbsp;<br>

<a href="http://seasilver.threadnet.com/Preventorium/transmute.htm"> the initial input of 13.3 milligrams of magnesium dropped as low as 3.2 milligrams (a fall of 335 per cent) while the initial input of 7.3 milligrams of potassium rose to 16.6 milligrams (an increase of 133 per cent).&nbsp;</a><br>
It is fair to add that scientists at other institutions have attempted to replicate these results and have found no evidence of transmutation (for instance professor Jungermann at University of California in 1977 and Carolyn Damon of the US Customs in 1978).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">
Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, a celebrated French chemist, discovered that chickens could produce more calcium in their eggshells than entered their bodies.</a>  Hence they had to be able to "create" the calcium, else their own bodies would have been completely depleted.<br>
In 1822 an Englishman named <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm"> William Prout had studied chicken eggs in incubation.  He found that hatched chicks had more lime (calcium) in their bodies than was originally present in the
egg</a>!<br>
Another French scientist named Henri Spindler discovered that a kind of algae called Laminaria could create iodine.<br>
A German researcher named Vogel had planted cress seeds in a bell jar.  They were fed nothing but distilled water; still, when grown they contained more sulphur than had been in the seeds originally.<br>
C. Louis Kervran, the Conferences Director at the University of Paris, published in La Revue Generale Des Sciences in July 1960, and then published further details of his work in a book, Transmutations Biologiques, Maloine, Paris 1962.<br>
<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">
As Kervran pointed out, the ground in Brittany contained no calcium; however, every day a hen would lay a perfectly normal egg, with a perfectly normal shell containing calcium.  The hens do eagerly peck mica from the soil, and mica contains potassium - a single step below calcium in the standard
hens denied calcium but not potassium, stay perfectly healthy and lay perfectly normal eggs.  Hens denied both potassium and calcium will be sickly and lay only soft-shelled eggs.  If these sick chickens are allowed to peck only mica - which they will frantically do - everything returns to normal again.</a>
<br>Kervran published the findings in his book "Biological Transmutations" (Kervran, L.C. (1966) "La Transmutation
Biologique", Le Courier du Livre, Paris). He believed that biological transmutations were best attained by
maximizing the "vital forces". Thus natural rainwater should be used rather than distilled tap water; the growth medium should be natural in origin rather than inorganic chemicals; lighting should be natural daylight, or direct sunlight rather than artificial, electric lighting; also the phases of the moon were implicated in the chances of a transmutation occurring.</font>
<br>Kervran found that in nuclido-biological reactions, oxygen is always in the
form of O, never O<sub>2</sub>; reactions with nitrogen occur only with N<sub>2</sub>,
insofar as is known. The following reactions (shown in simplistic form) have
been observed:</font></p><font size="2">

J.E. Zundel, head of a paper company with a chemical analysis laboratory, and later a chemical engineer of the Polytechicum School of Zurich, Switzerland, utilized the mass spectrometer at the Microanalysis Laboratory of the French National Scientific Research Center, and neutron activation mass analysis at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research in Villigen to positively confirm,
in the output of the hens, <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">an increase in calcium of 61% to an accuracy of 2%.</a>  Such results and instrumentation, of course, removed any doubt that the effect could be due to statistical variation.  In the same experiments, the
<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm"> plants increased their phosphorus 29% and their sulphur
36%</a>.<br>
In 1965,
Hisatoki Komaki, professor of applied microbiology at Mukogawa University, Japan, reported the formation of phosphorous in a wide range of microorganisms grown in a medium deficient in
phosphorous.
He suggested that nuclear reactions were taking place in the cells of the microorganisms.<br>
When he became the head of a research laboratory at Matsushita Electric Company,
Komaki conducted research conclusively proving that microorganisms (including some bacteria and two kinds each of molds and yeast) could transmute sodium into potassium.  In fact, he placed a brewer's yeast product on the market that, when applied to composts, increases their potassium content. The Japanese researchers, having replicated Kervran's astounding results, recommended him to the Nobel Committee for a Nobel Prize for such epochal work.  Thus Kervran became a Nobel nominee, though he was not granted the prize.</font></p>

<p>In a letter (7 January 1974), Kervran attributed the transmutations in plants
in part to the power of enzymes:</p>
<dir>
  <p>In a Petri dish 9 cm. in diameter I started germinating 50 oat seeds. The
  culture continued for 6 weeks or 3.6 million seconds give or take a few ten
  thousands of seconds... The area of 'cosmic interaction' was 63 cm<sup>3</sup>...
  During this time on this surface <a href="http://www.life-enthusiast.com/ormus/orm_bio_transmut.htm">3.9
  mg of K were transmuted into Ca</a>; this must be ~ 6 x 10<sup>19</sup> atoms
  of K transmuted in 3.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> seconds or 1.8 x 10<sup>13</sup> atoms
  per second or 2.6 x 10<sup>11</sup> per cm<sup>2</sup>/second. The proportion
  of K transmuted was ~ 46% in 6 weeks. This integration of results for the
  phenomenon is not constant: it is imperceptible during the first days when one
  witnesses the synthesis of enzymes which will provoke the transmutations; <a href="http://www.life-enthusiast.com/ormus/orm_bio_transmut.htm">even
  at the end of a week the effect is hardly to be noticed. It develops rapidly
  during the 2nd and 3rd weeks, then slows down during the 4th week</a>... The
  phenomenon seems to be asymptotic and at the end of the 6th week transmutation
  progresses only very slowly.. <a href="http://www.life-enthusiast.com/ormus/orm_bio_transmut.htm">Which
  demonstrates yet once again that the action of the ambient is insufficient,
  that there is an energy regulated by the metabolism of the germination and
  growth which is at the origin of these transmutations</a>... Obviously this
  calculation was one for a macro-section and not for the effective section...
  Moreover, there is in biology an important phenomenon which must not be
  overlooked: some molecules assemble in helix shapes (DNA and RNA for example).
  There are also some oriented assemblages which polarize light, most often to
  the left. These oriented constructions have an oriented electromagnetic field,
  and a molecule such as DNA can be compared to a solenoid in which charged
  particles (mu<sup>-</sup> for example) are somehow partly channeled in the
  interior, and thus concentrated...&nbsp;</p>
</dir>

<p>French physicist Oliver Costa de Beauregard, Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Institut de Physique Theorique Henri Poincare (Faculty of Sciences, Paris) who is also Director of the Centre National de la Reserche Scientifique (C.N.R.S.) suggests that such transmutations neither takes place through strong interactions, nor through electromagnetic forces, but through the weak interaction. This takes place through the neutral current of the intermediate vector boson, the so called Zo particle recently discovered by particle physicists.
<a href="http://www.levity.com/alchemy/afrm0350.html"> Kervran's reaction for a biological transmutation from Potassium (K) to Calcium (Ca) in germinating oats is thus explained as being initiated by neutrino capture (from cosmic rays)</a> and the weak interaction follows mediated by the Zo neutral current (the Z° probably existing as a virtual particle):<br>
neutrino + Hydrogen ion + Potassium ion -- Zo/enzyme--&gt; Calcium ion + antineutrino

</p><p>
In 1978 Solomon Goldfein of the US Army's Material Laboratory at Fort Belvoir suggested a possible mechanism for biological transmutations. He suggests that such transmutations would most likely involve an organic molecule with a central metal atom: Magnesium Adenosine Triphosphate (or Mg-ATP).&nbsp;<br>
Goldfein says that a stack of these molecule could form a helical chain. The Mg-ATP could also produce oscillating electric currents which act as a
microminiaturized cyclotron, accelerating hydrogen ions to speeds near that of light and giving them enough potential to transmute an element to the next higher number in the table of elements.&nbsp;
<br>Goldfein, the principal investigator of an US Army study, quotes from the Report 2247, Energy Development from Elemental Transmutations in Biological Systems, U .S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command, May 1978. DDC No. AD AO56906 which suggests that cold fusion is taking place in biological entities:&nbsp;<br>
"The purpose of the study was to determine whether recent disclosures of elemental transmutations occurring in biological entities have revealed new possible sources of energy.  The works of Kervran, Komaki, and others were surveyed, and
<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm"> it was concluded that, granted the existence of such transmutations (Na to Mg, K to Ca, and Mn to Fe), then a net surplus of energy was also produced.  A proposed mechanism was described in which Mg adenosine triphosphate, located in the mitochondrion of the cell, played a double role as an energy producer.  In addition to the widely accepted biochemical role of MgATP in which it produces energy as it disintegrates part by part, MgATP can also be considered to be a cyclotron on a molecular scale.
</a>  The MgATP when placed in layers one atop the other has all the attributes of a cyclotron in accordance with the requirements set forth by E.O. Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. "
"<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">It was concluded that elemental transmutations were indeed occurring in life organisms and were probably accompanied by a net energy
gain.</a>"&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/aids/ch5.htm">lieutenant

</font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">Light becomes polarized as it enters the atmosphere at low angles. Moonlight and skylight are polarized, as is&nbsp;
reflected light.&nbsp;Birds can detect polarized light from sunlight's penetration through the atmosphere, and it has been hypothesized that the pattern of polarized light in the evening sky is the primary cue that provides a reference for their orientation.
Experiments with caged homing <a href="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/educ/science/1999/10-26-98.htm">pigeons
have demonstrated that they will alter their behavior when, with the Sun in the
same position, the location of artificially polarized light is changed.</a>
<br>Horizontally polarized ultraviolet light reflected from the surface of water is the main optical cue for habitat finding by insects living in, on, or near water.<br>
The adaptations of the visual system of insects living in, on, or near water to reflection-polarization patterns at water surfaces are briefly reviewed and discussed by means of three representative species, viz. the waterstrider
(Gerris lacustris), the backswimmer (Notonecta glauca), and the dragonfly (Hemicordulia
tau).<br>
Dung beetles active during the day depend on sunlight polarization patterns. On moonlit nights, one twilight-active species worked particularly late. At sunset the African dung beetles
(Scarabaeus zambesianus) is able to orientate itself using the polarization pattern formed around the setting sun, but when the sun is 18 degrees beyond the horizon, known as astronomical twilight, the pattern is lost. But the moon will create a new polarized path in the sky. It lasts for as long as the moon is in the sky.
Polarized moonlight allows the dung beetle to find its burrow after gathering dung food.

</p><p>The scales on butterfly wings were known reflect light waves in only one plane. The latest experiments on the butterfly Heliconius
cydno, which is common in tropical rainforests in Central and South America, "put a whole new perspective on butterfly-wing evolution", says team member Alison Sweeney of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. They pinned female butterfly wings to a board, in front of which they placed neutral or depolarizing filters. They then released five male butterflies nearby and counted how many times these flew towards the female wings. The males approached more often when the female wings were under the neutral filter, which let their natural effect on light waves shine through. A display viewed through a depolarizing filter seemed to leave the males cold.

<a href="http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00068L"> The degree of polarization usually reaches about 75% at maximum and the peak is at around
550nm wavelength. </a> The fact that it isn't 100% is due to a number of factors including multiple scattering, ground reflections and aerosols. The more additional scattering
(Mie or Rayleigh) that occurs in the lower atmosphere, the lower the degree of polarization. So the more junk you have to look through, the less polarized the sky tends to be.

The polarization of the rainbow is caused by the internal
reflection into the water particles. The first refraction (A) separates the sunlight into its component colors, the reflection from the inner surface
(C) polarizes the light and the second refraction (B) increases the separation. The rays strike the back surface of the drop
(C) close to the Brewster angle, so almost all the light reflected is polarized.
The drops of water refract and reflect the rays from the sun backwards, at 42 degrees to the incoming rays.
Thus, the rainbow is seen in a direction opposite to the sun.&nbsp;<br>
<a href="http://polarization.com/rainbow/rainbow.html">
The primary rainbow is 96% polarized while the secondary is 90% polarized. The extra brightness of the sky inside the primary rainbow (and outside the secondary rainbow) is also polarized tangentially.</a><br>
The most common halos are the <a href="http://polarization.com/rainbow/rainbow2.html" name="Sun Dogs"> Sun Dogs (also called mock suns or false suns): bright multi-colored patches of light on both sides of the sun (to find them extend from the sun one hand at arm

<p>The eye displays birefringence, a property which
enables it to identify the polarized light. The minimal value of the birefringence always appears in the corneal centre and varies from 9 to 43° for different corneas.
<a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1475-1313.2003.00128.x/abs/"> Birefringence of the cornea increases monotonically more than one order in the direction of the corneal periphery.</a>
A small hour glass shaped patch at the side of our retinas is polarized and can see the plane of polarization of light.
On this this patch are appearing "Haidinger's fringes" and as it is at the side of the eye,
you have to learn to see out of the corner of your eye to see the plane of polarization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Molecules of air in our atmosphere act to polarize sunlight. By this, it is
meant that when photons come in contact with a molecule of air, they'll vibrate
more in one direction than another. <a href="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/educ/science/1999/10-26-">To
an observer on the surface extremely sensitive to polarized light, some path
angles through the air transmit light more readily than do others</a>. Light is
most polarized 90 degrees away from the Sun. For example, at sunset the light is
most polarized directly overhead. You may be able to see this without having to
use a polarizing filter. As the Sun is setting, look overhead and you may notice
a faint, violet, bow tie-shaped area above you that points north and south. This
is called Haidinger's Brush.</p>

<p>In 1846 Haidinger was studying minerals under polarized light, carefully trying to discern any special pattern in the refracted light. He then perceived a faint yellowish stain or brush that remained when he looked directly at the light without interposing the crystal.
<a href="http://polarization.com/haidinger/haidinger.html"> The brush rotated together with the polarizer proving that he was "seeing" the polarization state. That stain is now known as the Haidinger's brush, and he can be credited with the unique discovery of an extra
"sense"</a>. However, more that a century and a half later, this phenomenon remains little known (even by scientists working in optics!).</p>

<p>Haidinger's brushes are a faint blue and yellow dumbbell-shaped image that is produced in the human eye by the selective absorption of polarized light by the yellow macular pigment of the fovea,
Lutein, and can be used to detect polarized light without special equipment. Lutein is a long chain molecule that absorbs more for light polarized with the electric vector parallel to the molecular axis than for the perpendicular polarization.&nbsp;(THE ROLE OF THE MACULAR PIGMENT IN THE DETECTION OF POLARIZED LIGHT. Bone,
R.A., Vision Research 20:213,
1980)
<br>Lutein is a yellow lipid and its name comes from the Latin word luteus, "saffron-yellow." It is an antioxidant that is found throughout the body, but is concentrated in the macula. Lutein
protects the eyes from free radical damage caused by the sun's harmful rays.&nbsp;Lutein absorbs near-to-UV blue light.
<br>Lutein from food is deposited in the macula lutea, or
"yellow spot", in the retina. Several studies have shown a positive relationship between consumption of lutein and a lower incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.&nbsp;
<br>Researchers at the University of Utah recently conducted a study that showed that lutein may offer protection to cone cells in the retina.
Lutein works extremely well in protecting the retina against sunlight damage.&nbsp;<br>
"<a href="http://www.focusnewsletter.org/aletter.htm">I now take 20 mg Lutein each morning and in one month have noticed a tremendous change in the sun. I almost gave up daytime driving a month ago as the sun was bothering me so much. The lutein has made a huge difference in my
life.</a>"

<p>Into a study, 34 smokers and 34 nonsmokers were compared. <a href="http://www.lef.org/prod_hp/abstracts/php-ab167.html#2"> The smoking group had a mean Macular pigment optical density, MP,  of 0.16 (SD = 0.12) compared to a mean MP of 0.34 (SD = 0.15) for nonsmokers.</a><br>
Another study regarding the sex differences in macular pigment (MP) optical density showed that
<a href="http://www.lef.org/prod_hp/abstracts/php-ab167.html#2"> males had 38% higher MP density than females</a> despite similar plasma carotenoid concentrations and similar dietary intake.<br>
<br>Lutein levels in the eye are unaffected by light and oxidation throughout the day.
<br>Lutein is found in many foods including corn, dark leafy greens, collard greens,
kale, leeks, peas, spinach, romaine lettuce, peppers, squash, red grapes and
eggs.
</p>

<p>
In 1954, William Shurcliff (then employed by Polaroid) pointed out that the Haidinger's brush can also detect circular polarized light and distinguish the sense of rotation.<br>
How to see polarization with the naked eye: "I can see it particularly clearly in the twilight when I stare at the zenith; the whole sky seems to be covered by a network, as it were, and everywhere I look I see this characteristic pattern. It is very pleasing to be able to determine the direction of polarization without an instrument in this way, an even obtain an estimate of its degree"
Minnaert, Light and Color in the Outdoors

<p> 
Analyzing the change in appearance of the Haidinger brushes when the incoming polarization state was varied, van Blokland and Verhelst concluded that the cornea behaved as a biaxial crystal with its fastest principal axis normal to the corneal surface and
<a href="www.iovs.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=3559783&amp;displayid=121036&amp;link_type=INFOTRIEVE">its slowest principal axis

<p>In 1848, Louis Pasteur, found that a beam of polarized light passing through a pure solution of naturally produced organic nutrients, would
rotate the plane of polarization both right and left but would not rotate through artificially synthesized organic nutrients.
<br>The amino acids, with the exception of glycine, exhibit optical activity (rotation of the plane of polarized light).
Proteins are usually levorotatory ( L- form, they rotate the plane of polarization to the left) when polarized light of wavelengths in the visible range is used.&nbsp;Nearly all amino acids in biological systems are
levorotatory,
while all sugars, including deoxyribose an important component of DNA, are
always right handed or dextrorotatory (they rotate the plane of polarization to the

Bruce Garetz and colleagues at Polytechnic University in New York and the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago illuminated an aqueous solution of glycine
with either linearly-polarized or circularly-polarized light from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser.<br>
Not only does the laser dramatically speed up the nucleation of glycine crystals, but
<a href="http://optics.org/articles/news/8/10/17/1"> the polarization determines which of three polymorphs (crystal structures) of
glycine, called alpha, beta and gamma,
forms</a>. The alpha structure is made up of stacked planes, while the gamma structure consists of many parallel, twisting strands.<br>
"Using circularly polarized light the alpha-polymorph is always produced," claim the researchers. On the other hand, linearly-polarized light from the laser promoted exclusive formation of the gamma structure.<br>
Previous work by the group had suggested that polarized light accelerated crystal formation by helping to align the dissolved molecules in clusters.&nbsp;

<br>The polarized light has shown the following effects:
<br>•    The activation of ATP production (ATP is an important storage and energy transfer mechanism in the human body);<br>
•    Increased support for the multiplication of collagen fibres;<br>
•    The enhancement of important specific enzymes involved in cell regeneration;<br>
•    Support for the lymphatic system for cellular regeneration;<br>
•    Support for the development of new blood vessels;<br>
•    Creation of a significant increase of DNA and protein synthesis within the cells of the body.
<br>Exposure of a small skin area (400 cm2) of healthy volunteers to visible (400 - 2000 nm) incoherent polarized (VIP) light (degree of polarization &gt; 95%) in therapeutic doses (4.8 - 9.6 J/cm2) induces a rapid structural-functional modification of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and some plasma components in the whole circulating volume of blood.
<br>"We have recorded changes in: lipid peroxidation (LPO) produce content in erythrocyte membranes, deformability and viscosity of erythrocytes, phagocytotic activity of
monocytes, cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells against target malignant cells, release of bactericidal proteins by
granulocytes, plasma content of LPO-produces and pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukine-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, total anti-oxidant activity of plasma. Most of these effects were of regulative character, as their direction and extent depended on the initial level of the studied parameters: the initially low indices increased, while the initially high ones decreased or remained unaffected. In 24 h the changes were still detectable in 33 - 62% of volunteers. We have shown a great similarity of the blood changes induced by the skin exposure and by the direct irradiation of blood in vitro. Moreover, we obtained an evidence that the light-induced rapid modification of the entire circulating blood resulted from the direct effect upon it of transcutaneously irradiated blood, rather than of other systems of organism."

</p>
<p><font size="2">Cornea absorbs essentially all UVC and 40% of 320 nm radiation and longer wavelength radiation.&nbsp;<br>
Lens of a young eye will absorb most ultraviolet below 370 nm. As the lens yellows with age, it absorbs more ultraviolet, as much as 99% radiation between 320 nm to 340 nm and 98% of 360 nm and 90% of 400
nm. <a href="http://icare4u.com/Ultravio.htm">A child’s lens absorbs only a of fraction UV compared to an adult's
lens</a>. About 50% of your cumulative, lifetime sun exposure occurred by age 16.
(link: <a href="http://starklab.slu.edu/lens.JPG">photos of</a><a href="http://starklab.slu.edu/lens.JPG">
fresh lenses from the eye bank are from 79 year old (top) and 39 year old (bottom)
donors</a>).&nbsp;
<br>Age-related mechanisms of repair of UV damage are postulated that may diminish or be overwhelmed with age or cumulative UV exposure.<br>
 When the lens
becomes opaque due to cataracts, it may be surgically removed, and can be
replaced with an artificial lens. Even with the lens removed (a condition known
as aphakia) the patient can still see, as the lens is only responsible for about
30% of the eyes' focusing power. However, <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/medicalscience/story/0,9837,724257,00.html"> aphakic patients report that the
process has an unusual side effect: they can see ultraviolet light</a>. It is not
normally visible because the lens blocks it. Some artificial lenses are also
transparent to UV with the same effect. The receptors in the eye for blue light
can actually see ultraviolet better than blue. Military intelligence is said to
have used this talent in the second world war, recruiting aphakic observers to
watch the coastline for German U-boats signaling to agents on the shore with UV
lamps.<o:p>
<br>It has been suggested that without a UV-absorbing lens, there would be
cumulative damage to the retina, but aphakic patients do not seem to suffer
seriously even after many years. However cutting out UV gives us sharper vision.
This is because a lens can only focus a limited range of colours at the same
time. Increasing the range of wavelengths leads to a distortion called chromatic
aberration, which will be familiar to people with cheap camera lenses. <o:p>
</o:p>
<br>The eye represents a compromise between clear focus and breadth of
spectrum. 
<br>An illustration of how
ultraviolet appears is provided by the Impressionist painter Claude Monet.
Following cataract surgery in 1923, his colour palette changed significantly; <a href="http://starklab.slu.edu/Monet.jpg">after
the operation he painted water lilies with more blue than before</a>. This may
be because after lens removal he could see ultraviolet light, which would have
given a blue cast to the world. <o:p>

Professor Karel Tan, has published research on the nearest visible equivalent.
His conclusion is that it looks whitish blue or, for some wavelengths, a whitish
violet. <o:p>
<br>This appears to be because the three types of colour receptor (red, green
and blue) have similar sensitivity to ultraviolet, so it comes out as a mixture
of all three - basically white, but slightly blue because the blue sensors are
somewhat better at picking up UV. <o:p>

What does UV light look like? Actually, it looks a desaturated (whiteish) blue. I speculate that UV looks whitish blue because all three cones are
sensitive to UV light but that the blue cone is especially UV sensitive.
<br>The graph is showing the scotopic sensitivities from aphakic and normal observers. The difference in the UV is due to the lens.
Is interesting to note that normal observers have an increasing UV sensitivity
for wavelengths lower than 350 nm.&nbsp;
<br>UV radiation (200-400 nm) is generally considered to be outside the range of visible illumination for mammals.
Experiments on hamsters confirm that wavelengths as low as 305 nm are transmitted through the clear ocular media to
the retina. Furthermore, low irradiances of broadband (340-405 nm) and
monochromatic (360 nm) UV radiation are capable of suppressing high nocturnal
levels of pineal melatonin in intact, but not blind, hamsters. These data
indicate that the hamster eye and neuroendocrine system are able to detect and
respond to near-UV wavelengths. (Brainard GC, Podolin PL, Leivy SW, Rollag MD, Cole C, Barker

<p>The energy output of the Sun has its peak at a wavelength of 470 nanometers,
but the ozone and the atmosphere are absorbing in different amounts the visible wavelengths,
so that the peak luminance on the earth's surface results at 540 nm.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><font size="2"><img border="0" src="images/specsens.gif" align="left" width="258" height="339"><img border="0" src="images/sensitivity.gif" width="368" height="364">The
The left diagram
shows our overall light sensitivity in daylight vision, for a 5° visual area
(red dot line). This is quite close to the peak sunlight luminance (in terms of number of photons at the earth's surface) around 540 nm.&nbsp;You
can directly see the color of this peak sensitivity after <i>briefly</i> looking
at the sun. It produces a brilliant and beautiful yellow green <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color3.html#posafter">positive
afterimage</a>. The explanation for this peak sensitivity is that vision is
tuned to the wavelengths where sunlight is brightest (most abundant) at the
surface of the earth.
<br>The diagram shows that the eye is more sensitive to the
ultraviolet than to infrared radiation. The explanation is found into the right
diagram, which shows that dark adapted or scotopic (rod) vision extends into
ultraviolet. Thus, compared to a yellow green light, a scarlet light must emit 2
times as many photons, and a blue violet light 20 times as many, to appear
equally bright.&nbsp;
<br>The visible spectrum represents the range of electromagnetic
radiation that <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color13.html#colorcauses">interacts
with matter</a> in the most complex and varied ways (at least 14 ways, to be
exact). This in turn causes changes in light that are most informative about the
chemical or molecular structure of surfaces and objects. In short, vision is
tuned to the wavelengths that tell us the most about the world.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/fovea.gif" align="right" width="200" height="339">The
retina has roughly 100 million rods adapted for dim light and night vision and
the 6 million cones that give us daylight contrast and color. The distribution of photoreceptor cells varies considerably across different parts of the retina (diagram at right). The fovea contains a "central bouquet" of only two types of cones (R and
G); the B cones and rods are entirely excluded. This allows a tight packing of anywhere from 160,000 to 250,000 cones per square millimeter — an average cell spacing (about 2.5 to 2 microns) that equals the eye's maximum possible optical
resolution.&nbsp;Occasionally the R and G photopigments become chemically almost
or exactly identical, making the relatively small wavelength separation between
the R and G cones disappear. This results in a male color anomaly called
dichromacy (or "red-green colorblindness"). <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html">About
6% of healthy males have this restricted discrimination on the r/g opponent
contrast; they have particular trouble distinguishing among warm colors and
bluish greens. More than one type of R cone can be found in about 50% of normal
women and 10% of normal men (about 32% of all people), which increases long
wavelength sensitivity even more.</a>
 The research on cone responses to light show <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html">very
large variations across individuals in color vision</a>.
<br>The rods, that are absent from the fovea but form a dense, diffuse ring of cells at about 20° around it,&nbsp;
are providing dim light vision that is very poor at resolving visual detail or texture. The density of rods remains relatively high over more than half the eye's interior surface, and is
higher on the nasal side of each eye, where the rods provide enhanced peripheral vision in dim light.&nbsp;
<br><a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html">There are only about 1
million separate nerve pathways from each eye to the brain. This means that the
average pathway must carry information from 6 cones <i>and</i>  100 rods!</a>
This pooling of so many rod outputs in a single signal considerably reduces
scotopic visual resolution: even under optimal circumstances, rod visual acuity
is only about 1/20th that of the cones, which is why it's impossible to read a
book by moonlight.
<br>The retina includes several types of cells, such as <i>midget
ganglion</i> and <i>parasol cell,</i> which group neighboring cones and rods
into <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color11.html#centsurr">center/surround
receptive fields</a>. These transform the individual photoreceptor outputs into
contrasting <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color11.html#csdimensions">channels
of color information</a>, and sharpen the image edge and contrast resolution
based on the relative proportions of stimulation received by adjacent cones. So
the retina does not merely respond to light, but it also transforms and sharpens
the image before it sends the information to the brain for more complex
interpretation.&nbsp;
</font></p><font size="2">
<p><font size="2">When the photopigment is struck by a photon it instantly snaps or
uncoils. As the number of snapping photopigments within the inner segment increases, the intensity of the nerve output from the cell also increases.&nbsp;<br>
The rods and cones are fitted with a small ionic "pump" that continuously expels ions of sodium (Na+) inside the cell as it brings ions of potassium (K+) from outside. The resulting imbalance produces a small, steady electric current across the cell body.
<a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html"> The action of light can increase or decrease this baseline electric potential. In other words, the rods and cones produce a continuous visual signal, unlike other sensors which are active only when stimulated.</a></font>
</p>
<p>The iris acts like a shutter to expand or contract the pupil
opening from a minimum of 2mm up to a maximum of 5mm (in the elderly) to 8mm (in
young adults). This can reduce the amount of light entering the eye by up to
95%. However, this represents a tiny fraction of the total range of illumination
the eye can handle. The major changes in <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color13.html#luminadapt">luminosity
adaptation</a> occur in the retina and brain; the iris makes prompt
adjustments to relatively small changes in light intensity.&nbsp;
<br>A piece of white paper viewed in direct noon sunlight is roughly 6.3 million
times brighter than the same paper viewed under starlight! In fact, the eye is
capable of making lightness discriminations across a 10 <i>billion</i> fold
change in light levels. This vastly exceeds the range possible with any film or
photosensitive material, and leads to the phenomenon of <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color13.html#luminadapt">luminosity
adaptation</a>. <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html">Lightness
contrast discrimination peaks for surface areas about 1/3d the apparent diameter
of the full moon.</a>
</p>
<p>All primates — monkeys, apes and humans — acquired a second set of contrasting receptor cells: the R and G cones. This r/g contrast evolved from a genetic alteration in the mammalian Y cones, which divided into two receptors that differ only slightly in the chemistry of the photoreceptor molecule.
<br><font size="2">The primate brain is enlarged in the specific areas concerned
with vision (occipital lobes).<br>
The occipital lobes are almost exclusively concerned with the reception of
visual impulses. Damage to one side leads to homonymous hemianopia, loss of all
sight in the field of vision on the other side. This deficit applies to either
eye: with a lesion of the right occipital lobe, for example, a patient is blind
to any visual stimulus presented from the left side,<br>
whether to the right or to the left eye.<br>
A sleep research by Neils Rattenborg, reported in the February 4, 1999 issue of
Nature, showed that when ducks sleep in the water in a row, the outer ducks on the row actually sleep less
and keep an eye open facing the outside of the group, presumably to check for danger while sleeping.<br>
Rattenborg said: "<a href="http://www.exn.ca/html/templates/htmlpage.cfm?ID=19990203-51">The EEG recordings confirmed that when one eye was open, the corresponding
hemisphere was in a quiet waking state, while the opposite hemisphere was experiencing slow wave sleep.</a> [When faced with a video of a predator's<br>
approach,] . . . the wakeful hemisphere was capable of predator detection: the ducks initiated escape
behaviour. The ducks would also make sure to
alternate which of their halves was getting shut-eye -- and shutdown brain activity -- by rotating their bodies to switch the side that was facing
outwards."<br>

<p>Surya Vigyan is an alchemy employing solar energy. This solar science is one of the most significant sciences of ancient India. This science has been known only to the Indian Yogis and using it, one substance can be transformed into another through the medium of sun rays.&nbsp;
<br>Surya Vigyan involves the following practices:
<br><b>1. Daily purification through Arghyam</b>
<br>By this process, the element of Aditya (Sun) within us can be cultured and acquires the qualities of Aditya - namely lustrous and health preserving quality of the body and mind., light body, high intellect with grasping power, high intuition, memory and many other qualities.<br>
By offering "Arghya", water thrown up from the palms of both hands. Arghya must be offered
at sunrise at noon and at sunset, while seeing the sun and meditating on Aditya
(Sun). By this means, there are destroyed the demons attacking the sun, known as Mantehars
.&nbsp;<br>
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/sandhya/contents.html">
The Arghyams offered as worship to Sun or Aditya will help free the sun element in us. The word Manteha also means body, therefore the word mantehars refers to the devils in our body.</a><br>
In Atharvanam 1-22 is written: "Anu Surya mudayatam hrudhyo harimacate goro hitasya Varnena tenatva
paridadhmasi" which means that <a href="http://www.mypurohith.com/Rituals/Aditya_Hrudayam10.asp">leucoderma
and heart diseases when are attacked by exposure to the red rays of Sun, the health will be
resorted</a>.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/Surya_yantra.gif" align="right" width="180" height="180">The complexion of Sun god is red. When worshipping Surya Deva in the form of Surya yantra, it proceeds from the
circumference to the centre. The first group are the 10 dikpalas, or guardians
of the directions.
<br>In some tantras, the Sun receives worship as Martanda Bhairava, and is pictured in an Ardhanareshvari form, half of his body being
male, the other being female. His shakti is Prakasha Shakti, that is his energy
of Light.
<br>
<b>2. Pranayama </b>
 (breathing techniques)
<br>
<a href="http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~fmorale1/prana.htm">Prana is said to be the Sun that imparts life and light to all and dwells within the heart as the Self of all
creatures</a>. Prana in us makes us live and allows us to act. Alternate nostril breathing is the most important method for
keeping our masculine and feminine energies in balance. Another practice is <a href="http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/download/kundalini.pdf">
Svara Sadhana</a>: "If the breath flows through Ida (left nostril) from sunrise and throughout

"Very few Yogins do Trataka on the sun (sungazing). It requires the help of an experienced man by
their side. They begin to gaze on the rising sun and after gradual practice they do Trataka on the sun
even in the midday. They get some special Siddhis (psychic powers) by this practice."

<br>In the Ramayana, we read how Vibhisana worships the sun with raised arms (Uttarakanda,

It eliminates all fatigue, heaviness and laziness in few minutes. The experts of the science of mudras claim that regular and long-term practice of this mudra awakens supernormal powers hidden in the human psyche.<br>
The ring finger and the thumb are used in this mudra. The ring finger is folded down to touch the

ceiling of the church from Sucevita, a 16th century monastery from Romania. The
rays from the background are clearly suggesting the solar nature of old man who
is doing the gesture of blessing in Russian style, with both ring finger and
little finger folded. This gesture is identical with "Mano Pantea", “The Hand of the All
Goddess”, which&nbsp; was a Roman sign of Blessing. It was later adopted by Christian clergymen. In Islam it is called the Hand of Fatima.
<br> "Mano Pantea" was linked to the cult of Sabazius as a personification
of justice.&nbsp;Sabazius, or Sabadius,. the father god of the Phrygians and Thracians,
was known also as Sabbaoth/Sabaoth, one of the scriptural titles of God.
Migrating Phrygians brought Sabazios with them when they settled in Anatolia (ca. 1200 BCE?) and that the god's origins are to be looked for in Macedonia and western
Thrace, where was venerated by Thracians as the liberator from the cold season
and was the solar patron of horses. In Bulgaria, the summer solstice sun is
called Sabo, in a custom from the Thracian ancestors.
<br>Romans identified the Jewish Yahveh Sabaoth ("of the Hosts") as Sabazius: "The same praetor compelled the Jews, who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius, to return to their homes."&nbsp;
(Valerius Maximus, Nine Books of Memorable Deeds and Sayings i.3, 2)&nbsp;The date corresponds to 139 BCE.<br>
The ancient "Main de justice," (hand of justice) surmounting the staff which was used in France at coronations, and was pre. served in the treasury of St. Denis. This hand appears on the seal of Hugh Capet, and was continued till the time of the Renaissance.

<br>Swami Vishuddhanandji (d. 1937)(sometimes spelled: Vishuddhananda,
Vishudhanandaaka; aka: Gandha Baba, Perfume Saint), was well-known for his
supernatural powers and said to be an adept associated with the mysterious <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/nine_siddhis.html#N10"><b><u>Gyanganj</u></b></a>
 (Jnanaganj) hermitage somewhere in Tibet, a secret place of great masters.
<br>Paul Brunton, in his book A Search in Secret India, wrote that he witnessed how Swami Vishuddhananda
created a scent out of the air that Brunton had named, using a hand lens with wire frame and wire handle and the
reflected rays of the sun. He used a white handkerchief that the focused rays
had touched for several seconds.&nbsp;<br>
Brunton saw then Vishudananda breaking the neck of a sparrow and, after an hour
of being dead, producing its temporary resurrection
using the sunlight reflected by a mirror and the lens, with which focused the
light into the bird's eye.
<br>Swami Vishuddhananda and Swami Viryananda could revive dead birds by concentrating the Sun's rays on the dead body. Gopinath Kaviraj has recorded that he himself saw Vishuddhananda reviving a dead bird thus.<br>
This science has been kept alive by Divyendu Ghosh and some other Yogis, otherwise it has become almost extinct.&nbsp;<br>

</font></font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">"Think of it this way," said God.  "You are like a candle in the
Sun.  Oh, you're there all right.  Along with million, ka-gillion<br>
other candles  who make up the Sun.  And the sun would not be the Sun without you.   Nay, it would be a sun without one of its
candles. . .and that would not be the Sun at all; for it would not shine as brightly.    Yet, how to know yourself as the Light when
you are amidst the Light-that is the question."<br>
"Well," the Little Soul perked up, "you're God.  Think of something!"<br>
Once more God smiled, "I already have," God said.  "Since you cannot see yourself as the Light when you are in the Light, we'll surround
you with darkness."  "What's darkness?"  the Little Soul asked.<br>
God replied, "It is that which you are not." (Neale Donald Walsch, The Little Soul and the Sun)</font>
</font></font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">"Not only supplies come in these rays, but also beings come to earth to do a certain task and then go back to
the sun to be recharged and restored." (Omraam Michael Aivanhov, <a href="http://www.prosveta.com/main.phtml?date=2004-10-15&amp;distributor_id=600&amp;language_id=5">Light Is
A Living Spirit</a>)
</font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">After 40 days Maitreya destroyed the body and returned the particles, the tiny Devic lives (Solar Pitris) which made it up, to the sun from which they came. Maitreya mentions "tiny Devic lives (Solar Pitris)" in his discussion of returning the particles making up Jesus' light body to the sun.&nbsp;<br>
The Solar Pitris, or Archangels, become the very avatars of the spiritual Sun's power.&nbsp;<br>
The Pitris are very sacred among the Brahmins, because they are the Progenitors, or ancestors of men -- the first Manushya on this Earth -- and offerings are made to them by the Brahmin when a son is born unto him. They are more honoured and their ritual is more important than the worship of the gods.<br>
There are seven classes of Pitris enumerated in the Purânas -- but only three classes (Solar Pitris
or Agnishvattas) are composed of the progenitors (from pitar = father) of primeval man; one class creates the form of man, or rather becomes, that form (or physical man) itself; the other two are the creators of our souls and minds. Nearly all the Purânas agree that three of these Pitris are arupa, formless, while four
(Lunar Pitris) are corporeal; the former being intellectual and spiritual, the latter material and devoid of intellect.
The masculine creative power of the three solar Pitris, called Agni-dagdha
("Fire-givers") in Rig Veda, fecundates the feminine nature of the four lunar
Pitris, an earthly essence, and out of this union are coming the living beings.<br>
<br>
According to the Markandeya Puran, the Sun is the embodiment of Brahma, the world originates from the Sun and
is established in it.&nbsp;
<br>
The passage of Krama-Mukti, the gradual liberation of the soul attained by
Saguna-Upasanas, or qualitative meditations, is always traversed through the sun. The sun is regarded as a very important place, a halting point of the soul in the gradual ascent to the Absolute. Of all the deities who are supposed to direct the soul onwards in its passage upwards, the sun is considered the most important. It is a very prominent location where the soul is not only purified in an intensive manner but is landed in the realm of light as it finds itself in the region of the sun.&nbsp;<br>
The soul that is to depart the body, after having completed its career of life through meditation in this manner, prays to the sun for opening a passage. The immediate experience after the body is cast off is one of ascent to the sun.&nbsp;
<br>This view is presented into the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, CHAPTER V,
Fifteenth Brahmana, where is a PRAYER TO THE SUN BY A DYING PERSON. Into the
fourth paragraph it is written:<br>
agne naya supatha, raye asman; visvani, deva, vayunani vidvan;<br>
yuyodhy asmaj juharanam eno: bhuyistham te nama-uktim vidhema.&nbsp;<br>
Agne naya supatha raye asman: O Divine Fire! Lead us along the right path;
<br>Visvani deva vayunani vidvan: O Cosmic Fire god, you know everything, you are
omniscient;
<br>Yuyodhy asmaj juharanam eno: If we have done any mistake, please destroy these
errors:
<br>Bhuyistham te nama-uktim vidhema: We prostrate ourselves before you, again and again.</font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">A
similar view is presented into Chandgogya Upanisad 8.6:
<br>5 But when he is departing from this body, he rises up along those same rays. He goes up with the sound 'OM'. No sooner<br>
does he think of it, than he reaches the sun. It is the door to the farther world, open to those who have the knowledge but closed to
those who do not.&nbsp;
<br> 6 In this connection, there is this verse:<br>
One hundred and one, the veins of the heart.<br>
One of them runs up to the crown of the head.<br>
Going up by it, he reaches the immortal.<br>
The rest, in their ascent, spread out in all directions. (Patrick Olivelle,
Upanisads: Oxford world's Clasics)</font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2">In the sixth chapter (sixth prapatraka) of&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.gatewayforindia.com/upanishad/maitrayeni_upanishad.htm">MAITRAYANA-BRAHMAYA-UPANISHAD</a>,
is described the relationship between the sun and the individual souls. The
basic ideas can be presented as follows:
<br>At the birth, the self, coming from the sun, enterers the new born baby, through the first breath, and establishes its location in the heart. With each heartbeat, the inner self takes energy from the body and
grows stronger.&nbsp;<br>
At the death, that inner self leaves the body and returns to the sun.
<br>If the sun was not worshipped during the life, the soul will feed the sun
with his energy and when it will become depleted, it will reincarnate, to regain
its energy.
<br>This Upanishad states that a man should worship the sun under the name of
time. As we'll see, such practices were also used in the ancient Persia,
Babylon, Greece and Rome.&nbsp;
<br>The offering which is offered in the fire, goes to the sun. That is the main
reason for the cremation rituals from ancient India. The dead body is offered to
the sun, by cremation, facilitating the liberation of the soul and ending the
cycle of the reincarnations.
<br>The most relevant paragraphs of <font size="2">the sixth chapter (sixth
prapatraka) of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gatewayforindia.com/upanishad/maitrayeni_upanishad.htm">MAITRAYANA-BRAHMAYA-UPANISHAD</a>
are:
<br>1. The Sun is the outer Self, the inner Self is Breath.<br>
2. And he who having entered the inner lotus of the heart, devours food, the same, having gone to the sky as the fire of the sun, called Time, and being invisible, devours all beings as his food.<br>
16. Brahman is the Self of the sun, and a man should worship the sun under the name of time.&nbsp;<br>
30. Aditya (sun) is the cause of new births (to those who do not worship him), of heaven (to those who worship him as a god), of liberty (to those who worship him as Brahman).<br>
34. the adorable splendour of Savitri (sun) is to be meditated on by him who, abiding within his mind, meditates thereon. Here he attains the place of rest for the mind, he holds it within his own Self.<br>
37. 'The offering which is offered in the fire, goes to the sun; the sun rains it down by his rays; thus food comes, and from food the birth of living beings.'<br>
38. He who offers the Agnihotra breaks through the net of desire. […] meditating on one desire (that of liberty), he breaks through the shrine of Brahman.</font>
</font></font></p><p><font size="2"><font size="2"><img border="0" src="images/anahata.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="375">Your heart opens to the light. It welcomes it in. Around the beautiful light at the centre of your heart (Anahata), are arrayed a series of petals, traditionally described as four layers of three petals. At the base of each petal is a point of light. These twelve points of light arrayed around your heart centre are especially receptive to light. They draw it in like a thirsty person drinking water.<br>
In your own heart centre, at the centre of the flower is a pure light sometimes called the sacred flame.</font></font></p><p align="left"><font size="2"><font size="2">The heart center (Anahata) has 12 petals, similar to the 12 signs of the zodiac, through the sun is passing during the
year.<br>
 Anahata’s symbol (mandala) is made of two overlapping triangles, one pointing upwards and one downwards (the star of David), symbol which means, among other, the communion of the polarities (as in the sun) and the similitude of the “above” with the “bellow” (outer - inner
sun). One triangle, facing upward symbolizes Shiva, the male principle. The
other triangle, facing downward, symbolizes Shakti, the female principle. A
balance is attained when these two forces are joined in harmony. It is in the
heart chakra that <b>Kundalini Shakti appears for the first time as a beautiful
goddess</b>. Similarly, according to the talmudic tradition, the union of
<font size="2"><i> Tiphareth</i> and <i>Shekhinah</i>  also takes place in the
heart<i>.</i> </font>
<br><font size="2"><img border="0" src="images/sephirot.gif" align="left" width="140" height="249"></font>In
the Sephiroth, Anahata corresponds to Tiphareth (= beauty), which is</font></font>
<font size="2">the sixth stage of the Sephiroth (= numbers), the centre and the Sun of the entire Tree. Tiphareth
(6) circulates the energy among the upper and lower Sephiroth as indicated by the symbol of the hexagram. Here, the powers to left and the right, the above and the below can enter a stage of balance, beauty and harmony through a mutual process of healing sacrifice.
Tipheret is represented by the torso, heart, and spine and is the mediating force between judgment and mercy.&nbsp;
<br>
The mystic sacrifices his personality (Netzach through Malkuth) for obtaining contact with the Soul in Tiphareth. This Heart centre (= Anahata) or Higher Self, also called The Holy Guardian Angel, provides us with intuitions that "feel right", instant wisdom without sensory imagery, mystical experiences that end in blinding light.
<br>
At the same time, Tiphareth is the place where the Divine sacrifices itself (Kether through Geburah) in order to enter into incarnation, the centre of sacrificed gods (Christ) and gods coming within range of human consciousness ("whoso hath seen me hath seen the Father").
<br>
Tiphareth is the switching point where divine powers are transmitted into human existence, and where we become aware of our spiritual mission on earth, the Great Work. Tiphareth illustrates the unique position of the human race as a healing mediator between heaven and earth.
<br>Malkut (10) is the feminine emanation similar to Shakti or Kundalini and
corresponds to the Muladhara chakra. It is also figured as the queen, mother,
and daughter, the outlet from which the divine spirit,
<i>Shekhinah,</i>  enters the world. Tipheret and Malkut never separate but
complete each other. One can only be understood and discerned through the other.
Their union takes place in the heart centre (Anahata) and their mystical
marriage in the divine realm brings harmony to the world.&nbsp;
<br>

"Each soul and spirit prior to its entering into this world, consists of a
male and female united into one being. When it descends on this earth the two
parts separate and animate two different bodies. At the time of marriage, the
Holy One, blessed be He, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as
they were before, and they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it
were the right and left of one individual." (from the Zohar)<br>
The adversary to spiritual growth is called Vrtra. It is the kundalini in a
dormant state. Vrtra keeps the kundalini from rising up the sushumna. The power of Vrtra is referred to as "Avarana Shakti". Avarana Shakti can literally mean "the power to hinder in time and space." Vrtra is the root power of the ego, and has the power to hinder our spiritual growth in the field of time and space, but not the power to hinder our true power or essence (Indra). It would be correct to call it the root power of the ego.<br>
From the standpoint of chakras Vrtra manifests as the lower manifestation of the
manipura (3rd or navel) chakra. Actually the lower functions of the first three
chakras are the playground of Vrtra. In our society it has been taught, at
times, that the mind is ruled by the manipura chakra. Actually the mind should
be ruled by the Anahata chakra (4th or heart center). Once the mind activities
are ruled or governed by the anahata chakra, the higher function of manipura
chakra is activated opening the power of iccha shakti (the power of the will,
desire, and love).<br>
